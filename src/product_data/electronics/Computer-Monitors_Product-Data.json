Seriously a couple of tweaking in the settings and this monitor looks gorgeous.\n\nOut of the box it looked great, but for the best settings: put up the sharpness to 80, brightness to 100, and make sure to change to 75hz refresh rate. You might be confused on how to get to 75hz because it doesn't show up in NVIDIA control panel. In order to change the refresh rate to 75hz you have to right click on the desktop, go to display settings, then advanced display settings, then display adapter properties for display (1 or 2), then click the monitor tab and you can only change it there.\n\nAbsolutely worth the money."},{"name":"Just a customer","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"2/5","reviewTitle":" IT SILENCES YOUR COMPUTERS AUDIO - Here's what you need to know","review":"This can save you a lot of troubleshooting that leads only to a dead end.\n\nThere are NO SPEAKERS in this monitor - HOWEVER IT STILL TAKES OVER (shuts down) YOUR AUDIO. Plug it in and you'll have no volume out of your computer (or monitor) - whatsoever. And to keep you confused to the max, there are volume settings in the monitor's settings - and LG's online \"help\" (videos and web pages) tout these volume controls as your answer. Great decoy to keep you thinking the monitor in fact has speakers. Complete waste of time.\n\nSO KNOW THIS - these volume settings are ONLY for the headphone jack on the back of the monitor. So by plugging in this monitor, you give up your computer speakers for the monitor's headphone jacks. Really??? This is a feature???? Wired headphones overrides all??? Is this still the 1980's??? Anyway.....\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\n1) Use the monitor with headphones for sound. I'm not a big fan of wired headphones. Too easy to choke on them.\n2) Send it back if you wanted speakers on the monitor. I didn't, and I was OK with the computer's speakers.\n3) In Windows, change your computer's default audio device back to the computer's speakers.\na) For Windows 10 Click Start\nb) <type \"Sound\" then ENTER>\nc) Under Sound, select the computers speakers. On my laptop, it was called \"Speakers (High Definition Audio Device\"\n\nBest of luck......"},{"name":"Music Lover","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" It works and provides great value","review":"I bought this monitor three months ago when my employer sent me home to work and I realized that I hadn't grabbed my work monitors.\nWhen it arrived, I took it out of the box, attached the mount, and plugged the HDMI cable into the monitor and my laptop.

Or just get a Logitech stereo system, and plug the 3.5mm wire & jack to this (I got mine- with an HDMI cable from the PC to this) long story.
