For the price, it's much warmer than I thought and has well thought out features. So far I've worn this in 42F weather, coldest and just going on a walk I was breaking a bit of a sweat with it half zipped. It has 2 exterior pockets and 2 internal pockets. Personally I wouldn't put too much in these, as I can really feel the thing stretch and drag down. Just gloves, hat, phone etc. should be fine, nothing like a can of soda or something. Water resistance is what you expect for thin nylon stuff, a few drops is fine, actual rain, get an umbrella or an actual waterproof layer. It's also pretty windproof, took it out in the aftermath of a pseudo hurricane and didn't feel the wind.\n\nIt packs down pretty well into a 6 inch long 3 inch or so bundle but nothing like the high tech hiking stuff, I just wish there was a shorter loop so I can carabiner it to my pack easier but seems like it was intended to be carried like an umbrella. Also wish it packed into itself rather than have a bag which may get lost one day. The material imo isn't very durable, I have no rips yet, but I'm not confident and think if I rub on something the wrong way it's going to tear. The stitching seems fine so far, and doesn't seem to be leaking filler yet.\n\nSizing wise, I have a 45 chest and usually wear XL, but this is kinda big even for an XL, maybe because they were antiicpating you layer something like a thick sweater underneath. It is also a bit long for my torso, about 2-3 inches more than I need to sit at my waist. I have 23 sleeves and that fits perfect.\n\nI don't expect this to last a long time, but it's useful for the time I'll have it.\n\n12/28 edit:\nSo I just used this exactly for what I bought it for because of the huge winter storm that swept across the north and east coast US. Temps went from nearly 60 degrees in daytime all the way down to 23 by late afternooon with extremely high winds that were throwing doors around and knocked some street signs off their mounts, and it was perfect. I just had a t-shirt underneath and on top of this was a gymax waterproof windproof jacket. Again my only complain might be if the material doesn't last and it's a bit long."},{"name":"Christopher Zele","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Great inexpensive puffer jacket","review":"I was able to snag one of these puffer jackets for my Step Dad for $21 for Christmas. It runs a little bit big and he normally is a Medium, but I bought him a Small and that seems it will be perfect for him. The quality of the material is very nice they used a good filler and the jacket feels nice when I tried it on to see how it would fit. Most puffer jackets are $40 or $30, so when I saw this for the low $20s I had to pick one up.\n\nYou can fold this puffer jacket up into a ball, which is a nice plus if you're hiking somewhere cold and it warms up in the afternoon and you want to put the jacket away.\n\nThis jacket definitely feels like a $40+ product. I own an Old Navy Puffer Jacket, which I've used for years and a Patagonia one. This  one is very close in quality to the Old Navy one. It feels good to the touch and looks sharp.\n\nIf I was in the market for another gift for someone, or I needed another puffer jacket for myself I would definitely buy an Amazon Basics because they're both cheap and high-quality."},{"name":"Nunya001","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Big Performance for a very low cost","review":"I bought this jacket to wear at work - I make a wood product and I'm outside in all weather. I need jackets to be no fuss and functional but also affordable so if I tear it, spill oil on it, burn it with welding sparks I can shrug it off and buy a new one. As a point of reference Patagonia is my personal go to outdoor wear supplier, but that's way too expensive for work.\n\nI've been wearing this jacket now for a couple of months. Just went out in 13 F with pretty decent wind gusting - warm and comfortable. It's cut allows good movement and it's not so bulky so you can put a shell over it in wet weather, although I've worn it in the rain without a shell and it does pretty well.

But price wins and it is warm, it works for what I use it for. The fit is more of a traditional fit that is to say a large is baggy for my slim fit preference. I am a man who is 190lbs 5'11. Before the pndmic I was 175 (got gains) and would have gotten a small knowing the sizes haha #goals.\n\nIf you want a long term thermal go buy a brand name it will look 6 times better, but this thing has its place for sure!! I like things more tight fitted and in my post pndmic body i'd get a medium or probably a small to wear under a jacket. So if I was 175-180 i'd probably get a small I think to wear under stuff, but a medium if its the main thing and you don't like fitted clothes.\n\nI planned to get 2 of these with one to wear to work and another to get dirty from yard work and outside things. I first ordered a large and it is baggy for my preference but probably what most men would want. I like fitted clothes and have ordered another one in size medium to wear to work. I am keeping the large for yard work and other things. Great to have 2 or 3 instead of one high priced item.\n\nHope it helps!"},{"name":"Clau","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Excelente compra!!!","review":"Est√° incre√≠ble la calidad.

I would opt for XL a lot of the time but with reviews saying this ran big I decided to stick with the large.\n\nThis is made of really sturdy materials. Not as sturdy as something like a Carhartt for example, which in my opinion is almost too tough (and quite a bit more expensive), but it feels like this is built to last a good while. The detachable hoodie part is a really cool touch. The wrist cuffs have two buttons for a looser or tighter fit. The inside of the torso is sherpa while the inside of the arms is a nice quilted material.

For the price, it's much warmer than I thought and has well thought out features. So far I've worn this in 42F weather, coldest and just going on a walk I was breaking a bit of a sweat with it half zipped. It has 2 exterior pockets and 2 internal pockets. Personally I wouldn't put too much in these, as I can really feel the thing stretch and drag down. Just gloves, hat, phone etc. should be fine, nothing like a can of soda or something. Water resistance is what you expect for thin nylon stuff, a few drops is fine, actual rain, get an umbrella or an actual waterproof layer. It's also pretty windproof, took it out in the aftermath of a pseudo hurricane and didn't feel the wind.\n\nIt packs down pretty well into a 6 inch long 3 inch or so bundle but nothing like the high tech hiking stuff, I just wish there was a shorter loop so I can carabiner it to my pack easier but seems like it was intended to be carried like an umbrella. Also wish it packed into itself rather than have a bag which may get lost one day. The material imo isn't very durable, I have no rips yet, but I'm not confident and think if I rub on something the wrong way it's going to tear. The stitching seems fine so far, and doesn't seem to be leaking filler yet.\n\nSizing wise, I have a 45 chest and usually wear XL, but this is kinda big even for an XL, maybe because they were antiicpating you layer something like a thick sweater underneath. It is also a bit long for my torso, about 2-3 inches more than I need to sit at my waist. I have 23 sleeves and that fits perfect.\n\nI don't expect this to last a long time, but it's useful for the time I'll have it.\n\n12/28 edit:\nSo I just used this exactly for what I bought it for because of the huge winter storm that swept across the north and east coast US. Temps went from nearly 60 degrees in daytime all the way down to 23 by late afternooon with extremely high winds that were throwing doors around and knocked some street signs off their mounts, and it was perfect. I just had a t-shirt underneath and on top of this was a gymax waterproof windproof jacket. Again my only complain might be if the material doesn't last and it's a bit long."},{"name":"Christopher Zele","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Great inexpensive puffer jacket","review":"I was able to snag one of these puffer jackets for my Step Dad for $21 for Christmas. It runs a little bit big and he normally is a Medium, but I bought him a Small and that seems it will be perfect for him. The quality of the material is very nice they used a good filler and the jacket feels nice when I tried it on to see how it would fit. Most puffer jackets are $40 or $30, so when I saw this for the low $20s I had to pick one up.\n\nYou can fold this puffer jacket up into a ball, which is a nice plus if you're hiking somewhere cold and it warms up in the afternoon and you want to put the jacket away.\n\nThis jacket definitely feels like a $40+ product. I own an Old Navy Puffer Jacket, which I've used for years and a Patagonia one. This  one is very close in quality to the Old Navy one. It feels good to the touch and looks sharp.\n\nIf I was in the market for another gift for someone, or I needed another puffer jacket for myself I would definitely buy an Amazon Basics because they're both cheap and high-quality."},{"name":"Nunya001","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Big Performance for a very low cost","review":"I bought this jacket to wear at work - I make a wood product and I'm outside in all weather. I need jackets to be no fuss and functional but also affordable so if I tear it, spill oil on it, burn it with welding sparks I can shrug it off and buy a new one. As a point of reference Patagonia is my personal go to outdoor wear supplier, but that's way too expensive for work.\n\nI've been wearing this jacket now for a couple of months. Just went out in 13 F with pretty decent wind gusting - warm and comfortable. It's cut allows good movement and it's not so bulky so you can put a shell over it in wet weather, although I've worn it in the rain without a shell and it does pretty well. I'm 6'2 185 with long arms and a medium fits just right.

See more for good info.","review":"Really great for the price $22 I got a large and ordering a 2nd that is medium, if I used it a lot (or it cost more) I would get something more durable like a name brand. But price wins and it is warm, it works for what I use it for. The fit is more of a traditional fit that is to say a large is baggy for my slim fit preference. I am a man who is 190lbs 5'11. Before the pndmic I was 175 (got gains) and would have gotten a small knowing the sizes haha #goals.\n\nIf you want a long term thermal go buy a brand name it will look 6 times better, but this thing has its place for sure!! I like things more tight fitted and in my post pndmic body i'd get a medium or probably a small to wear under a jacket. So if I was 175-180 i'd probably get a small I think to wear under stuff, but a medium if its the main thing and you don't like fitted clothes.\n\nI planned to get 2 of these with one to wear to work and another to get dirty from yard work and outside things. I first ordered a large and it is baggy for my preference but probably what most men would want. I like fitted clothes and have ordered another one in size medium to wear to work. I am keeping the large for yard work and other things. Great to have 2 or 3 instead of one high priced item.\n\nHope it helps!"},{"name":"Clau","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Excelente compra!!!","review":"Est√° incre√≠ble la calidad.

That was a great jacket as well but the outer material was different, more of a nylon woven type of material. This jacket is more of a shell. The design is very sharp, smooth and simple. The material is extremely resistant to dirt. I was recently working an event where the jacket was under a table on a concrete floor for the entire day. I was worried about it getting very dirty, but when I pulled it out there was no dirt on it in spite of there being a lot of dust bunnies.

I placed my arm under my water spigot and the water just bounced off and two quick shakes of my arm and it was dry. The inner liner is very good at storing body heat so you could probably get away with this being a three season jacket if you live in an area with relatively mild winters.\n\nFeatures\nThere are four pockets on the jacket I have, two traditional waist-level jacket pockets on the left and right with an inner pocket and an outer left arm pocket. The two hand pockets are decent but a little shallower than I expected. The inner pocket is nicely sized and readily falls to hand. I will likely never use left arm pocket as it feels odd to access and awkward to zip back up. Speaking of zippers, all of them appear to be of at least decent quality as the zippers feel decently robust and the tracks are metal. It is a bit annoying that the main zipper on this jacket is on the left which is different than any other jacket I have owned and takes a little brain retraining to get use to.\n\nOverall\nI have spent a lot of money on jackets in the past but also got my money's worth. I went a bit cheaper this time but I am pretty impressed even in the short time I've worn this one.

The rest of the fit is great, but the sleeve length needs to be dialed in a little better.\n\n(FYI, I'm only 6'1\" but I usually by Tall when ordering shirts)"},{"name":"‚úÖ SteP ‚úÖ","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"4/5","reviewTitle":" ESSENTIAL NEL NOME MA NON DI FATTO - CALD, MORBIDO E PERFETTO PER IL FREDDO","review":"üü• üüß üü® üü© üü¶ üü™ üü´üü• üüß üü®\nüö´ TEST E CONSIDERAZIONI: üö´\nüü• üüß üü® üü© üü¶ üü™ üü´üü• üüß üü®\nFelpa acquistata a marzo 2019 e recensisco ora, maggio 2020, a distanza di oltre 1 anno, dopo averla indossata parecchio, specialmente per stare nei dintorni di casa, non essendo elegante, ma davvero molto molto calda e pratica.\n\nLe lampo con cordino permettono di allacciarla e slacciarla al volo, sono davvero toste, sia quella per la chiusura della felpa che quelle delle tasche, sono lampo con chiusura femminile, ovvero al contrario di quella maschile, per intenderci il cursore lo farete scorrere con la mano destra anzich√® con quella sinistra come sono abituati gli uomini, ma poco male √® questione di abitudine.\n\nLa felpa √® in pile, molto comodo, caldo e soffice, tiene davvero caldo in inverno pieno anche con venticello moderato, ovviamente se il vento √® consistente l'aria passa, non essendo fatta di materiali wind stop.\n\nRisulta discretamente traspirante, tanto da non mettersi sonovuoto quando la indossate.\n\nIo sono alto 175cm e peso circa 72Kg, ho preso la taglia S e mi calza alla perfezione, stretta ma non troppo, perfetta di maniche.

inizio inverno, pur non essendo eccessivamente spesso.\n\nLe CUCITURE e quindi il confezionamento del tessuto, risultano discrete e sempre in linea con la tipologia sportiva/economica del capo, un pile che comunque non stona abbinato ad un paio di pantaloni sportivi, anche dei semplici jeans, per una abbigliamento molto informale e pratico che trovo apprezzabile nella nostra zona collinare di campagna, ma anche da utilizzare semplicemente in giardino o durante le escursioni con i nostri cani.\n\nNel complesso mi sento quindi di promuovere questa giacca della serie AMAZON ESSENTIALS, per le caratteristiche complessive del capo, acquistato a fine ottobre 2022 al PREZZO di 12.45 euro nella taglia M color ROSSO BISONTE, un costo che ritengo equilibrato.\nL'ultima verifica che andr√† fatta √® la reazione del tessuto dopo i primi lavaggi, ma √® probabile che valuter√≤ di acquistare altre colorazioni pi√π classiche.\n\nIn quanto alla spedizione e consegna da parte di , sono state anche in questa circostanza efficienti e puntuali grazie al servizio Prime.\nMi auguro che questa recensione possa essere di aiuto e se avete dubbi o quesiti non esitate a chiedere."},{"name":"Mr D","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Less is more.","review":"This may not be the best fleece jacket you will ever own, but it could well be the best value for money. Fleece is a fairly basic material that is reasonably warm, highly breathable and fairly light weight, compared to say wool. However it offers almost no protection against wind or rain so is best suited to being worn as a mid layer.\nThis jacket offers almost no frills e.g. no shoulder or elbow reinforced patches, no 2 way zip and not even a hem cord with cord locks. However most of these features merely add weight and cost and provide very little benefit in the real world.\nUltimately what really matters are decent materials, good quality construction and accurate sizing and happily this jacket is very good when it comes to these criteria.\nOverall this jacket provides good warmth, from a mid weight material, being around twice the weight of a micro fleece fabric. It fits me very well and the slightly elasticated cuffs and hem are sufficient to keep out any draughts. There are two hand warming outer pockets with zips and additionally 2 large inside ‚Äúpoacher‚Äù pockets big enough for a Ordnance Survey map but much more likely to be used for a hat or light weight windproof shirt/waterproof smock. The poacher pockets also provide a useful double layer of insulation, like wise the collar also has double thickness of material\nIf worn under a Goretex type jacket you may miraculously find that the jacket suddenly becomes far less leak prone. This is because around 99% of the moisture inside the jacket is not in fact rain coming in, but sweat that cannot get out, but can be managed very effectively by the fleece."},{"name":"B.M.","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"3/5","reviewTitle":" Good, with flaws","review":"Other reviewers have complained about the zip on ‚Äúwrong‚Äù side, but a more serious problem is that the 2 very useful inside pockets have slit holes in the bottom (maybe to allow MP3 headphones to be threaded through?) which makes them useless for keys, coins, smaller phones (my iPhone SE goes straight through). So you need an obliging lady with needle and thread to fix this first before you lose your stuff.

The first one that I purchased was in a regular size (not tall) and the fit was nice enough for me to wear holes in but the sleeves were a little on the short side. If I extended my arms out in front of me, the cuff of the sleeve would miss my wrist by about 4 inches. So with this purchase, I decided to account for that issue and I ordered a Tall size...now the cuff of the sleeves are like 5 inches too long. The rest of the fit is great, but the sleeve length needs to be dialed in a little better.\n\n(FYI, I'm only 6'1\" but I usually by Tall when ordering shirts)"},{"name":"‚úÖ SteP ‚úÖ","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"4/5","reviewTitle":" ESSENTIAL NEL NOME MA NON DI FATTO - CALD, MORBIDO E PERFETTO PER IL FREDDO","review":"üü• üüß üü® üü© üü¶ üü™ üü´üü• üüß üü®\nüö´ TEST E CONSIDERAZIONI: üö´\nüü• üüß üü® üü© üü¶ üü™ üü´üü• üüß üü®\nFelpa acquistata a marzo 2019 e recensisco ora, maggio 2020, a distanza di oltre 1 anno, dopo averla indossata parecchio, specialmente per stare nei dintorni di casa, non essendo elegante, ma davvero molto molto calda e pratica.\n\nLe lampo con cordino permettono di allacciarla e slacciarla al volo, sono davvero toste, sia quella per la chiusura della felpa che quelle delle tasche, sono lampo con chiusura femminile, ovvero al contrario di quella maschile, per intenderci il cursore lo farete scorrere con la mano destra anzich√® con quella sinistra come sono abituati gli uomini, ma poco male √® questione di abitudine.\n\nLa felpa √® in pile, molto comodo, caldo e soffice, tiene davvero caldo in inverno pieno anche con venticello moderato, ovviamente se il vento √® consistente l'aria passa, non essendo fatta di materiali wind stop.\n\nRisulta discretamente traspirante, tanto da non mettersi sonovuoto quando la indossate.\n\nIo sono alto 175cm e peso circa 72Kg, ho preso la taglia S e mi calza alla perfezione, stretta ma non troppo, perfetta di maniche.

inizio inverno, pur non essendo eccessivamente spesso.\n\nLe CUCITURE e quindi il confezionamento del tessuto, risultano discrete e sempre in linea con la tipologia sportiva/economica del capo, un pile che comunque non stona abbinato ad un paio di pantaloni sportivi, anche dei semplici jeans, per una abbigliamento molto informale e pratico che trovo apprezzabile nella nostra zona collinare di campagna, ma anche da utilizzare semplicemente in giardino o durante le escursioni con i nostri cani.\n\nNel complesso mi sento quindi di promuovere questa giacca della serie AMAZON ESSENTIALS, per le caratteristiche complessive del capo, acquistato a fine ottobre 2022 al PREZZO di 12.45 euro nella taglia M color ROSSO BISONTE, un costo che ritengo equilibrato.\nL'ultima verifica che andr√† fatta √® la reazione del tessuto dopo i primi lavaggi, ma √® probabile che valuter√≤ di acquistare altre colorazioni pi√π classiche.\n\nIn quanto alla spedizione e consegna da parte di , sono state anche in questa circostanza efficienti e puntuali grazie al servizio Prime.\nMi auguro che questa recensione possa essere di aiuto e se avete dubbi o quesiti non esitate a chiedere."},{"name":"Mr D","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Less is more.","review":"This may not be the best fleece jacket you will ever own, but it could well be the best value for money. Fleece is a fairly basic material that is reasonably warm, highly breathable and fairly light weight, compared to say wool. However it offers almost no protection against wind or rain so is best suited to being worn as a mid layer.\nThis jacket offers almost no frills e.g. no shoulder or elbow reinforced patches, no 2 way zip and not even a hem cord with cord locks. However most of these features merely add weight and cost and provide very little benefit in the real world.\nUltimately what really matters are decent materials, good quality construction and accurate sizing and happily this jacket is very good when it comes to these criteria.\nOverall this jacket provides good warmth, from a mid weight material, being around twice the weight of a micro fleece fabric. It fits me very well and the slightly elasticated cuffs and hem are sufficient to keep out any draughts. There are two hand warming outer pockets with zips and additionally 2 large inside ‚Äúpoacher‚Äù pockets big enough for a Ordnance Survey map but much more likely to be used for a hat or light weight windproof shirt/waterproof smock. The poacher pockets also provide a useful double layer of insulation, like wise the collar also has double thickness of material\nIf worn under a Goretex type jacket you may miraculously find that the jacket suddenly becomes far less leak prone. This is because around 99% of the moisture inside the jacket is not in fact rain coming in, but sweat that cannot get out, but can be managed very effectively by the fleece."},{"name":"B.M.","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"3/5","reviewTitle":" Good, with flaws","review":"Other reviewers have complained about the zip on ‚Äúwrong‚Äù side, but a more serious problem is that the 2 very useful inside pockets have slit holes in the bottom (maybe to allow MP3 headphones to be threaded through?) which makes them useless for keys, coins, smaller phones (my iPhone SE goes straight through).

It's warm.","review":"Quality is great. Inner lining is great. Color is great (I got blue).\n\nIt fits a little large on me. Some reviews said it fit a bit small. (Especially on the other Wrangler one like this with no hood)... I was worried I was going to have to get an XL. I got a large and it's a bit huge on me. No worries because I'm currently bulking up. (I'm 6ft tall and 210lbs) However, it makes me wonder how much shrinking I can expect from washing it. Normally I'm about 170 lbs and probably would've still taken a chance on Large... but apparently I would've been swimming in it. Even as it stands, it makes me look like I'm almost 300lbs because it's quite big.\n\nI also wondered (based on another review) if the color would be faded... but the blue is nice and vibrant.\n\nIt's a LOT more like a jacket than a regular hoodie. Partly due to the sort of quilted inner lining, partly due to how big and warm and cozy it is I guess. If it's around 0 degrees I can get away with just this plus t-shirt under, no REAL winter jacket/coat.\n\nLike some other options out there, the design for this one could've probably benefited from an inner zipper and then the buttons... and of course some dudes would prefer snaps instead of buttons.\n\nLady loves it. I'm impressed with it. It's warm. Pockets are useful."},{"name":"Merardo Garcia Gonzalez","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Chamarra Ligera, amplia y muy c√°lida.","review":"Ligera, Caliente, Ideal para utilizar por debajo de la misma alg√∫n su√©ter, playera o similar, buena manufactura, botones resistentes y bien fijos, ojales de buen tama√±o, bolsas amplias, gorro muy calientito y amplio.\n\nEs la primer prenda de esta marca que compro y quede muy satisfecho con mi compra, me gust√≥ su color y lo ligera y abrigadora que resulta ser.\n\nEn mi caso soy talla XL, me gusta andar holgado y no muy justo de talla, de igual forma pudiera haber sido la talla L pero no me quejo, en realidad muy satisfecho con la calidad del producto en relaci√≥n a su costo, entrega en 1 solo d√≠a y si problema.\n\nAmpliamente recomendable."},{"name":"Telnets","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"4/5","reviewTitle":" not a shirt","review":"Id never wear this as a \"shirt\".. but as a light spring/fall jacket i would.

Great for Fall and Winter.\n2) Looks good\n3) Fits\n4) Good casual wear for regular outings\n5) Good at blocking wind.\n\nCons:\n1) The textile used to make the zippers are indeed delicate. Will tear if you're brutish with it otherwise it's okay. It's about 1 tier below regular zippers we're all used to.\n2) Can tear if you're wearing this jacket for high activity outings like skiing etc.\n3) The first few minutes after donning the jacket and stepping outside may be a bit chilly (winter season) until you warm it up with your body heat. Like I said it's great at trapping heat.\n\nPro tip: After measuring the size to fit; buy 1 size larger. I had to return my first jacket b/c it fits too damn well; exposing the shape of my beer belly. My second one was 1 size larger (still fits) and that is where I gave it my 5 stars.
