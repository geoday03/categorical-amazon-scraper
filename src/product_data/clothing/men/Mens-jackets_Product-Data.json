        "review": "I feel like I got very lucky with my purchase here. I pulled the trigger on the tall and am so glad that I did because it's just the right length in the arms and the torso. For reference, I'm 6'3 and around 210lbs and I got the large tall. I would opt for XL a lot of the time but with reviews saying this ran big I decided to stick with the large.\n\nThis is made of really sturdy materials. Not as sturdy as something like a Carhartt for example, which in my opinion is almost too tough (and quite a bit more expensive), but it feels like this is built to last a good while. The detachable hoodie part is a really cool touch. The wrist cuffs have two buttons for a looser or tighter fit. The inside of the torso is sherpa while the inside of the arms is a nice quilted material. The front pockets for your hands are on the sides, although the pictures make it seem like they would go in under a flap. I got the brown version (lighter one) and it's exactly as pictured. Overall I'm happy with this coat overall and look forward to perhaps buying other colors."

        "review": "I had always wanted a winter coat that didn't quite look like one, or have the bulk and heft of one. The somewhat pseudo-military or even quasi-cowboy look has always appealed to me. I am thrilled with this coat. I usually wear a large, but with winter coats I tend to get a size up, to accommodate any garments underneath. It was the right call. The look is crisp and understated, which is what I was going for. With the hood, it's a blend of the trendy, with the classic.\n\nAs I wore it for the first time, I thought the only thing missing is the ability to remove the hood at my option. I checked, and low and behold, the hood can be unzipped and removed. I am not sure why this important feature was not mentioned. I almost did not buy it because I was debating that white hood. The fact that it can be removed is excellent.\n\nGreat coat."

The main issues I have had are that the zipper pull broke on day one - not a big problem, I was able to rig a replacement, and yesterday (just after the return period closed), a seam on the right sleeve at the back of the shoulder opened up about 4 inches. I had to take the jacket to a tailor to repair it. I have only worn the jacket a few times so far, so there's no way it should be coming apart already. Really not impressed.\n\nUpdate 22-2-22 - today the seam on other sleeve came apart as I was simply reaching up to take off my hat. This jacket is SUCH poor quality - I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAISNT BUYING ONE. I will be contacting the seller to see if they will refund, even though the date has passed."

I don't feel too hot wearing it in the upper 50s, and as long as I don't spend hours outside when it's in the 30s, it keeps me warm.\n\nMy only knock is that the sizing feels like it is from 20 years ago when everything was a bit more loose fitting. That's good if you want to layer up, but the styling is not the current trend of slim/ form fitting. Since I'm an older guy now, that's not as important to me, but it may be for others."

We were moving at a good pace with 40lb packs, but this jacket kept me at a perfect temperature for all days of the hike. At night, I wore it to bed in a 20-degree sleeping bag and it kept me toasty as overnight temps were near freezing. I thought it might be a single use type of product, but I continue to wear it as a primary option out and about when I want to stay warm. I‚Äôll likely take it on another trip and will happily do so. I wouldn‚Äôt trust it in a downpour, but it can take a short, light sprinkle without issue. Zipper is higher quality than expected, hood is prefect, comes with a small stash bag."

        "review": "This is a very lightweight yet effective jacket. Keeps you warm. It has two large pockets closed with zips (no chest pocket or inner pockets). The hood does not have a zip code to tighten around the face. The main zip slider is strangely on the left. It slides easily.\nBut this is a very comfortable jacket. Well worth the price. I ordered one size larger as my arms are longer than what it should be. So it fits slightly loose on the chest.\nOverall I like the jacket. Would recommend to others."

        "review": "Nice jacket. Smooth, soft, warm, comfy. I'm a 41\" chest and it fits nicely around my shoulders chest and arms, but it's pretty baggy around the stomach. As there's no elastic at the bottom it's pretty loose. Will likely see if a tailor can put some elastic in it or something. Probably better off waiting to see if Trespass have anything in the Christmas sales to be honest."

        "review": "100% Good value for money\nQuality is better than what I paid.\nOnly one suggestion or downside, this is not adjustable, they could easily make this adjustable but still deserves 5 star\nReduced 5 to 4 stares for the following reasons:\n1) Zipper is apposite side (this is not related to cost )\n2) Tested on moderate chilli wind and it doesn't stand. (I understand it is a lightweight but I expect it holds for moderate cold weather )"
