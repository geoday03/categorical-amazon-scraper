				"review": "Not sure why the reviews imply it’s light weight. Maybe in Novosibirsk? It’s not heavy or light. It’s perfect for most fall winter and spring save for the coldest days. Tons of pockets. Well tailored for athletic body types. Not too tight on the chest, perfect on the shoulders, tapered down to a thinner waist. Sooo comfortable. No Cold draft of wind sneaks in. Get compliments on it every other day — mostly from women though. Works for me. Maybe dudes just need to find this review? If you’d ask I’d tell you where to find it but some of us be weird like that."

So get at least 1 size up, maybe even 2 - if you have a belly like me. It's not just the gut though, my XXL has the same sleeve length and shoulder clearance as an XL. That's probably the reason why XXL doesn't cost anymore, like most companies charge. Other than the size, the look and quality is nice, especially at this price."

That was a great jacket as well but the outer material was different, more of a nylon woven type of material. This jacket is more of a shell. The design is very sharp, smooth and simple. The material is extremely resistant to dirt. I was recently working an event where the jacket was under a table on a concrete floor for the entire day. I was worried about it getting very dirty, but when I pulled it out there was no dirt on it in spite of there being a lot of dust bunnies. Love the jacket and will replace it with the same kind when this one has lived its full life and moved on to jacket heaven."

Keeps the wind out well and is styled in a way that means it's probably more towards casual wear than technical.\n\nI didn't really love it in the end though because the sizing was too much on the large size. I'm on the small size really - 37\" chest, 5'7 height - supposedly a SMALL in Columbia, but although this fit okay, it wasn't the technical or slim fit I was hoping for - more baggy and boxy, hanging off me rather than close to the body. Great if you want a wear a full weight fleece underneath I suppose."

We live very remotely and the nearest tailor is over 2 hours away. When I asked whether there was another option they said NO.

I will practice more care when doing it up; just in case.\n5/15/22: Edit: Just out walking dog in what I would say was moderate to heavy rain and stayed dry under jacket.\nSomething else I forgot to mention: I really like the breast zipper pocket to store my smartphone while hiking.\n10/24/22: Edit: Zipper broke this AM. I haven't worn it over summer so not that much use; have to reduce the stars to 1. Everything else is fine but it has become a throw away and search for another jacket with sturdy zipper."

				"reviewTitle": " Review from a tall dude",
				"review": "I feel like I got very lucky with my purchase here. I pulled the trigger on the tall and am so glad that I did because it's just the right length in the arms and the torso. For reference, I'm 6'3 and around 210lbs and I got the large tall. I would opt for XL a lot of the time but with reviews saying this ran big I decided to stick with the large.\n\nThis is made of really sturdy materials. Not as sturdy as something like a Carhartt for example, which in my opinion is almost too tough (and quite a bit more expensive), but it feels like this is built to last a good while. The detachable hoodie part is a really cool touch. The wrist cuffs have two buttons for a looser or tighter fit. The inside of the torso is sherpa while the inside of the arms is a nice quilted material. The front pockets for your hands are on the sides, although the pictures make it seem like they would go in under a flap. I got the brown version (lighter one) and it's exactly as pictured. Overall I'm happy with this coat overall and look forward to perhaps buying other colors."

				"reviewTitle": " A Great Fit for an Understated Look",
				"review": "I had always wanted a winter coat that didn't quite look like one, or have the bulk and heft of one. The somewhat pseudo-military or even quasi-cowboy look has always appealed to me. I am thrilled with this coat. I usually wear a large, but with winter coats I tend to get a size up, to accommodate any garments underneath. It was the right call. The look is crisp and understated, which is what I was going for. With the hood, it's a blend of the trendy, with the classic.\n\nAs I wore it for the first time, I thought the only thing missing is the ability to remove the hood at my option. I checked, and low and behold, the hood can be unzipped and removed. I am not sure why this important feature was not mentioned. I almost did not buy it because I was debating that white hood. The fact that it can be removed is excellent.\n\nGreat coat."

				"reviewTitle": " Not good quality",
				"review": "I love the look of this jacket, but I must say the quality has left me disappointed. The fit is not overly generous for the size I bought, but it's OK. The main issues I have had are that the zipper pull broke on day one - not a big problem, I was able to rig a replacement, and yesterday (just after the return period closed), a seam on the right sleeve at the back of the shoulder opened up about 4 inches. I had to take the jacket to a tailor to repair it. I have only worn the jacket a few times so far, so there's no way it should be coming apart already. Really not impressed.\n\nUpdate 22-2-22 - today the seam on other sleeve came apart as I was simply reaching up to take off my hat. This jacket is SUCH poor quality - I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAISNT BUYING ONE. I will be contacting the seller to see if they will refund, even though the date has passed."

				"rating": "5/5",
				"reviewTitle": " Very impressive for $50",
				"review": "Let me start by saying that I have not had this jacket long enough to know how it will hold up over time but so far this jacket is amazing.\n\nFit\nAt 6'2\" / 200 (long legs) I was tempted to get the XL but got the Large as I wanted something really light as I have a full winter coat but could not be happier with sizing of the Large.\n\nMaterials\nThis jacket has a really soft and water resistant outer skin. I placed my arm under my water spigot and the water just bounced off and two quick shakes of my arm and it was dry. The inner liner is very good at storing body heat so you could probably get away with this being a three season jacket if you live in an area with relatively mild winters.\n\nFeatures\nThere are four pockets on the jacket I have, two traditional waist-level jacket pockets on the left and right with an inner pocket and an outer left arm pocket. The two hand pockets are decent but a little shallower than I expected. The inner pocket is nicely sized and readily falls to hand. I will likely never use left arm pocket as it feels odd to access and awkward to zip back up. Speaking of zippers, all of them appear to be of at least decent quality as the zippers feel decently robust and the tracks are metal. It is a bit annoying that the main zipper on this jacket is on the left which is different than any other jacket I have owned and takes a little brain retraining to get use to.\n\nOverall\nI have spent a lot of money on jackets in the past but also got my money's worth. I went a bit cheaper this time but I am pretty impressed even in the short time I've worn this one. I will add an edit if this impression changes due to unexpected quirks or wear."

Inside pocket is the same (single stitch). Zipper is cheap looking and not even close to what they showed on the photos. Pencil pocket is made with single layer of fabric with no thicken edge. If you use this, soon the fabric will be torn.\nSomeone mentioned that inside smells like old insulation. I agree. It has old hay like smell. I'm not sure if the smell goes away eventually. You need to order one size bigger than what you normally buy.\nWhat they showed as good features/quality are not there. You should check your jacket very closely if you bought one.

All seems ok but was not expecting to do this with a 50$ jacket. The size chart was missing to ended up ordering a Medium and a Large. I am 5'10'' and weight 180 lbs. Large was perfect for me.

				"reviewTitle": " Good cheaper alternative but not for heavy use",
				"review": "I bought for the purpose of travel and outdoor use in those times where temps can change drastically from 70F in the morning down to 40F at night.\n\nI got this on sale for $20 which was a far cry from $60-120 asking price of other packable down jackets. For the price, it's much warmer than I thought and has well thought out features. So far I've worn this in 42F weather, coldest and just going on a walk I was breaking a bit of a sweat with it half zipped. It has 2 exterior pockets and 2 internal pockets. Personally I wouldn't put too much in these, as I can really feel the thing stretch and drag down. Just gloves, hat, phone etc. should be fine, nothing like a can of soda or something. Water resistance is what you expect for thin nylon stuff, a few drops is fine, actual rain, get an umbrella or an actual waterproof layer. It's also pretty windproof, took it out in the aftermath of a pseudo hurricane and didn't feel the wind.\n\nIt packs down pretty well into a 6 inch long 3 inch or so bundle but nothing like the high tech hiking stuff, I just wish there was a shorter loop so I can carabiner it to my pack easier but seems like it was intended to be carried like an umbrella. Also wish it packed into itself rather than have a bag which may get lost one day. The material imo isn't very durable, I have no rips yet, but I'm not confident and think if I rub on something the wrong way it's going to tear. The stitching seems fine so far, and doesn't seem to be leaking filler yet.\n\nSizing wise, I have a 45 chest and usually wear XL, but this is kinda big even for an XL, maybe because they were antiicpating you layer something like a thick sweater underneath. It is also a bit long for my torso, about 2-3 inches more than I need to sit at my waist. I have 23 sleeves and that fits perfect.\n\nI don't expect this to last a long time, but it's useful for the time I'll have it.\n\n12/28 edit:\nSo I just used this exactly for what I bought it for because of the huge winter storm that swept across the north and east coast US. Temps went from nearly 60 degrees in daytime all the way down to 23 by late afternooon with extremely high winds that were throwing doors around and knocked some street signs off their mounts, and it was perfect. I just had a t-shirt underneath and on top of this was a gymax waterproof windproof jacket. Again my only complain might be if the material doesn't last and it's a bit long."

				"review": "I was able to snag one of these puffer jackets for my Step Dad for $21 for Christmas. It runs a little bit big and he normally is a Medium, but I bought him a Small and that seems it will be perfect for him. The quality of the material is very nice they used a good filler and the jacket feels nice when I tried it on to see how it would fit. Most puffer jackets are $40 or $30, so when I saw this for the low $20s I had to pick one up.\n\nYou can fold this puffer jacket up into a ball, which is a nice plus if you're hiking somewhere cold and it warms up in the afternoon and you want to put the jacket away.\n\nThis jacket definitely feels like a $40+ product. I own an Old Navy Puffer Jacket, which I've used for years and a Patagonia one. This  one is very close in quality to the Old Navy one. It feels good to the touch and looks sharp.\n\nIf I was in the market for another gift for someone, or I needed another puffer jacket for myself I would definitely buy an Amazon Basics because they're both cheap and high-quality."

				"review": "I bought this jacket to wear at work - I make a wood product and I'm outside in all weather. I need jackets to be no fuss and functional but also affordable so if I tear it, spill oil on it, burn it with welding sparks I can shrug it off and buy a new one. As a point of reference Patagonia is my personal go to outdoor wear supplier, but that's way too expensive for work.\n\nI've been wearing this jacket now for a couple of months. Just went out in 13 F with pretty decent wind gusting - warm and comfortable. It's cut allows good movement and it's not so bulky so you can put a shell over it in wet weather, although I've worn it in the rain without a shell and it does pretty well. I'm 6'2 185 with long arms and a medium fits just right. I wish it was 4 inches shorter - that's my only suggestion."

				"review": "Really great for the price $22 I got a large and ordering a 2nd that is medium, if I used it a lot (or it cost more) I would get something more durable like a name brand. But price wins and it is warm, it works for what I use it for. The fit is more of a traditional fit that is to say a large is baggy for my slim fit preference. I am a man who is 190lbs 5'11. Before the pndmic I was 175 (got gains) and would have gotten a small knowing the sizes haha #goals.\n\nIf you want a long term thermal go buy a brand name it will look 6 times better, but this thing has its place for sure!! I like things more tight fitted and in my post pndmic body i'd get a medium or probably a small to wear under a jacket. So if I was 175-180 i'd probably get a small I think to wear under stuff, but a medium if its the main thing and you don't like fitted clothes.\n\nI planned to get 2 of these with one to wear to work and another to get dirty from yard work and outside things. I first ordered a large and it is baggy for my preference but probably what most men would want. I like fitted clothes and have ordered another one in size medium to wear to work. I am keeping the large for yard work and other things. Great to have 2 or 3 instead of one high priced item.\n\nHope it helps!"

				"reviewTitle": " Good cheaper alternative but not for heavy use",
				"review": "I bought for the purpose of travel and outdoor use in those times where temps can change drastically from 70F in the morning down to 40F at night.\n\nI got this on sale for $20 which was a far cry from $60-120 asking price of other packable down jackets. For the price, it's much warmer than I thought and has well thought out features. So far I've worn this in 42F weather, coldest and just going on a walk I was breaking a bit of a sweat with it half zipped. It has 2 exterior pockets and 2 internal pockets. Personally I wouldn't put too much in these, as I can really feel the thing stretch and drag down. Just gloves, hat, phone etc. should be fine, nothing like a can of soda or something. Water resistance is what you expect for thin nylon stuff, a few drops is fine, actual rain, get an umbrella or an actual waterproof layer. It's also pretty windproof, took it out in the aftermath of a pseudo hurricane and didn't feel the wind.\n\nIt packs down pretty well into a 6 inch long 3 inch or so bundle but nothing like the high tech hiking stuff, I just wish there was a shorter loop so I can carabiner it to my pack easier but seems like it was intended to be carried like an umbrella. Also wish it packed into itself rather than have a bag which may get lost one day. The material imo isn't very durable, I have no rips yet, but I'm not confident and think if I rub on something the wrong way it's going to tear. The stitching seems fine so far, and doesn't seem to be leaking filler yet.\n\nSizing wise, I have a 45 chest and usually wear XL, but this is kinda big even for an XL, maybe because they were antiicpating you layer something like a thick sweater underneath. It is also a bit long for my torso, about 2-3 inches more than I need to sit at my waist. I have 23 sleeves and that fits perfect.\n\nI don't expect this to last a long time, but it's useful for the time I'll have it.\n\n12/28 edit:\nSo I just used this exactly for what I bought it for because of the huge winter storm that swept across the north and east coast US. Temps went from nearly 60 degrees in daytime all the way down to 23 by late afternooon with extremely high winds that were throwing doors around and knocked some street signs off their mounts, and it was perfect. I just had a t-shirt underneath and on top of this was a gymax waterproof windproof jacket. Again my only complain might be if the material doesn't last and it's a bit long."

				"reviewTitle": " Great inexpensive puffer jacket",
				"review": "I was able to snag one of these puffer jackets for my Step Dad for $21 for Christmas. It runs a little bit big and he normally is a Medium, but I bought him a Small and that seems it will be perfect for him. The quality of the material is very nice they used a good filler and the jacket feels nice when I tried it on to see how it would fit. Most puffer jackets are $40 or $30, so when I saw this for the low $20s I had to pick one up.\n\nYou can fold this puffer jacket up into a ball, which is a nice plus if you're hiking somewhere cold and it warms up in the afternoon and you want to put the jacket away.\n\nThis jacket definitely feels like a $40+ product. I own an Old Navy Puffer Jacket, which I've used for years and a Patagonia one. This  one is very close in quality to the Old Navy one. It feels good to the touch and looks sharp.\n\nIf I was in the market for another gift for someone, or I needed another puffer jacket for myself I would definitely buy an Amazon Basics because they're both cheap and high-quality."

				"reviewTitle": " Big Performance for a very low cost",
				"review": "I bought this jacket to wear at work - I make a wood product and I'm outside in all weather. I need jackets to be no fuss and functional but also affordable so if I tear it, spill oil on it, burn it with welding sparks I can shrug it off and buy a new one. As a point of reference Patagonia is my personal go to outdoor wear supplier, but that's way too expensive for work.\n\nI've been wearing this jacket now for a couple of months. Just went out in 13 F with pretty decent wind gusting - warm and comfortable. It's cut allows good movement and it's not so bulky so you can put a shell over it in wet weather, although I've worn it in the rain without a shell and it does pretty well. I'm 6'2 185 with long arms and a medium fits just right. I wish it was 4 inches shorter - that's my only suggestion."

				"reviewTitle": " Depends on the fit you like. See more for good info.",
				"review": "Really great for the price $22 I got a large and ordering a 2nd that is medium, if I used it a lot (or it cost more) I would get something more durable like a name brand. But price wins and it is warm, it works for what I use it for. The fit is more of a traditional fit that is to say a large is baggy for my slim fit preference. I am a man who is 190lbs 5'11. Before the pndmic I was 175 (got gains) and would have gotten a small knowing the sizes haha #goals.\n\nIf you want a long term thermal go buy a brand name it will look 6 times better, but this thing has its place for sure!! I like things more tight fitted and in my post pndmic body i'd get a medium or probably a small to wear under a jacket. So if I was 175-180 i'd probably get a small I think to wear under stuff, but a medium if its the main thing and you don't like fitted clothes.\n\nI planned to get 2 of these with one to wear to work and another to get dirty from yard work and outside things. I first ordered a large and it is baggy for my preference but probably what most men would want. I like fitted clothes and have ordered another one in size medium to wear to work. I am keeping the large for yard work and other things. Great to have 2 or 3 instead of one high priced item.\n\nHope it helps!"

				"review": "My hubby loses jackets frequently because he's on a job site, takes them off and they disappear.\nHe needed (another) casual jacket. Nothing to big and heavy like a coat. Just something for cold mornings but easy to stash when the day warms up. I picked this jacket because of the cost, to be honest. $15?? I figured it would be thin and cheap but if he lost this one too, no great loss. What a surprise when it arrived. A nice mid-weight fleece, heavy duty zipper, looks good, and looks like something I paid a lot more for. He's even hanging on to this one and hasn't lost it yet! Highly recommend!11"

I planned to use it as an under-layer on bike rides, but now find that it is also quite comfortable to wear while puttering around indoors.\n\nThe sizing makes no sense.  displayed \"large will fit you best\", but large was hopelessly long and baggy. The one I'm wearing in the picture is a medium size, which is comfortable but still a little too long for use with an outer shell-type bicycling jacket. I also purchased a small in a different color (forest green), but it is slightly tight in the stomach -- and still too long!\n\nThe camo colored one (medium size) is made in Vietnam. The forest green (small size) one is from Indonesia, and seems slightly less soft."

If you can find this fleece on sale like I did, buy it. It’s a really good find. I live in Maryland and it’s cold out right now. This fleece fits great and is keeping me warm. I’m also impressed with its comfort and zippered pockets. The pockets are really useful because they are deep pockets. So if you put your phone in one and forget to zip it up, you don’t have the feeling that anything will slip out of your pocket as you bend over to pick something up off the floor (like I do 300 times a day with my four y/o daughter)"

Love it.\n\nLarge size is perfect for me. I would like to give this fleece jacket 5 stars plus. Everything about the jacket is perfect. Very resonable price,very comfortable,very good quality... But the huge pockets inside have not sewn on purpose. I don't know why. The other brand of jackets with big pockets never have the issue like this.\nDon't put your cell phone inside the big pocket.\n\nSuggestion to Amazon: Please sew the pockets completely."

If I extended my arms out in front of me, the cuff of the sleeve would miss my wrist by about 4 inches. So with this purchase, I decided to account for that issue and I ordered a Tall size...now the cuff of the sleeves are like 5 inches too long. The rest of the fit is great, but the sleeve length needs to be dialed in a little better.\n\n(FYI, I'm only 6'1\" but I usually by Tall when ordering shirts)"

				"review": "Mi piacciono le camicie e le giacche sportive a quadrettoni e quando ho notato questa giacca in pile della serie AMAZON ESSENTIALS, con delle caratteristiche in descrittiva che erano interessanti, ho deciso di acquistarla per utilizzarla in campagna nelle nostre zone collinari, anche durante le escursioni con i miei cani.\n\nLa giacca arriva in una busta trasparente perfettamente piegata e non appena rimosso il capo ho potuto subito constatare una apprezzabile QUALITA' complessiva della giacca tutto sommato discreta, pur sempre proporzionata alla caratteristica economica del prodotto.\n\nConsiderando che siamo infatti difronte ad una GIACCA in PILE di fascia economica e piuttosto sportiva, non mi è dispiaciuta la scelta del tessuto integralmente sintetico (100% poliestere) che sebbene si percepisce subito risulta comunque sufficientemente morbida e piacevole sulla pelle.\n\nApprezzabile ho trovato anche il suo CONFEZIONAMENTO sufficientemente curato ed attento ai particolari, come entrambe le TASCHE esterne con CHIUSURA a CERNIERA, la ampia TASCA INTERNA aperta e l’ELASTICO ai POLSINI, senza trascurare la CERNIERA LAMPO FRONTALE, che però presenta l’unico “difetto” di essere al contrario, ovvero al femminile, scelta che ammetto non ho compreso e che in alcune circostanze mi procura qualche rallentamento nella chiusura.\n\nA proposito della CERNIERA LAMPO, non si tratta di una marca nota YKK come indicato in alcune recensioni, ma in questa colorazione rosso-bisonte è una più economica che però svolge egregiamente il suo compito, con innesti sufficientemente precisi e scorrimenti fluidi in apertura come in chiusura, peccato solo per il montaggio al contrario a cui molti dovranno abituarsi.\n\nMi è piaciuta invece la tonalità del TESSUTO a QUADRETTONI rosso/blu dallo stile vagamente nord americano, con un PESO medio ed una sufficiente morbidezza, che mi ha piacevolmente sorpreso per il CALORE che garantisce, perfetto per la stagione fredda in arrivo.\n\nConsiderando inoltre la economicità di questo pile, trovo comunque gradevole il confezionamento della giacca, senza evidenti difetti e con quel colletto alto chiudibile con la cerniera lampo fin sotto il mento, per una linea complessiva piacevole che gli conferisce una certa personalità e carattere.\n\nIl TAGLIO è ovviamente sportivo ed indovinando la propria TAGLIA corretta, la VESTIBILITA' risulta comunque discreta.\nNeppure le MANICHE le ho trovate abbondanti in lunghezza come a volte accade ed avendo seguito le indicazioni in descrittiva ho scelto correttamente la M.\nSi tratta di una MISURA che per me che normalmente indosso giacche taglia 48 è risultata corretta, senza abbondanza ma una apprezzabile comodità, che mi permette di vestire il PILE con sotto anche una camicia, una polo o comunque un ulteriore capo.\n\nDopo aver considerato attentamente le misure indicate in descrittiva, come da altri evidenziato suggerisco di valutare di acquistare una TAGLIA IN MENO a quella che normalmente si è abituati a vestire, si tratta infatti di un capo che veste largo e non ho neppure riscontrato la vita stretta come segnalata nelle descrizioni.\n\nNel cercare di offrire dei riferimenti i più precisi possibili in relazione alle MISURE della TAGLIA M da me ordinata, se vado a misurare la giacca a riposo su un appendiabiti, i valori che posso confermare sono:\nTORACE (solo frontale) 54.5 cm, SPALLE 43 cm, VITA (solo frontale) 52 cm, MANICA 65 cm da fine spalla a polsino.\n\nLa giacca si indossare bene, non lega, non vincola nei movimenti, consentendo di vestire sotto ancora un ulteriore capo non troppo aderente come una camicia.\nIl capo infatti non stringe ne a vita come neppure sulle spalla e garantisce quel calore che potrà migliorare il comfort quotidiano durante i primi abbassamenti di temperature di fine autunno - inizio inverno, pur non essendo eccessivamente spesso.\n\nLe CUCITURE e quindi il confezionamento del tessuto, risultano discrete e sempre in linea con la tipologia sportiva/economica del capo, un pile che comunque non stona abbinato ad un paio di pantaloni sportivi, anche dei semplici jeans, per una abbigliamento molto informale e pratico che trovo apprezzabile nella nostra zona collinare di campagna, ma anche da utilizzare semplicemente in giardino o durante le escursioni con i nostri cani.\n\nNel complesso mi sento quindi di promuovere questa giacca della serie AMAZON ESSENTIALS, per le caratteristiche complessive del capo, acquistato a fine ottobre 2022 al PREZZO di 12.45 euro nella taglia M color ROSSO BISONTE, un costo che ritengo equilibrato.\nL'ultima verifica che andrà fatta è la reazione del tessuto dopo i primi lavaggi, ma è probabile che valuterò di acquistare altre colorazioni più classiche.\n\nIn quanto alla spedizione e consegna da parte di , sono state anche in questa circostanza efficienti e puntuali grazie al servizio Prime.\nMi auguro che questa recensione possa essere di aiuto e se avete dubbi o quesiti non esitate a chiedere."

				"review": "This may not be the best fleece jacket you will ever own, but it could well be the best value for money. Fleece is a fairly basic material that is reasonably warm, highly breathable and fairly light weight, compared to say wool. However it offers almost no protection against wind or rain so is best suited to being worn as a mid layer.\nThis jacket offers almost no frills e.g. no shoulder or elbow reinforced patches, no 2 way zip and not even a hem cord with cord locks. However most of these features merely add weight and cost and provide very little benefit in the real world.\nUltimately what really matters are decent materials, good quality construction and accurate sizing and happily this jacket is very good when it comes to these criteria.\nOverall this jacket provides good warmth, from a mid weight material, being around twice the weight of a micro fleece fabric. It fits me very well and the slightly elasticated cuffs and hem are sufficient to keep out any draughts. There are two hand warming outer pockets with zips and additionally 2 large inside “poacher” pockets big enough for a Ordnance Survey map but much more likely to be used for a hat or light weight windproof shirt/waterproof smock. The poacher pockets also provide a useful double layer of insulation, like wise the collar also has double thickness of material\nIf worn under a Goretex type jacket you may miraculously find that the jacket suddenly becomes far less leak prone. This is because around 99% of the moisture inside the jacket is not in fact rain coming in, but sweat that cannot get out, but can be managed very effectively by the fleece."

				"review": "Other reviewers have complained about the zip on “wrong” side, but a more serious problem is that the 2 very useful inside pockets have slit holes in the bottom (maybe to allow MP3 headphones to be threaded through?) which makes them useless for keys, coins, smaller phones (my iPhone SE goes straight through). So you need an obliging lady with needle and thread to fix this first before you lose your stuff. Otherwise, an OK fleece, with two front zip pockets, rather loose fit on the chest, but good value for money."

				"review": "Well i bought this so i can have an affordable puffer jacket i can abuse and not feel bad about. used it for everything and anything that involved being cold outside.\nNot wanting to risk expensive jacket incase i ruin it or hate it i purchased this one but so far it has withstood the abuse. i am pleased with the purchase and i recommend it if your in the market for this item and price is an issue . i have used it for concerts ,camping ,late night shopping trips ,taking out the trash at 4 am also just for the random day hikes .\nthings i like it packs really small and is very light it also comes with its own drawstring bag that seams to match the color you purchased , i think anyhow because i have purchased 4 different colors (Christmas presents for family members ) and all come this way.\nAlso this thing does very well in windy conditions it seams to have a very thin feel for a puffer jacket but the small amount of insulations paired with the inner and outer shell of jacket material reminds me of safety blankets ability to reflect body heat back to you this feature for staying warm is doing great for lack of \"poof\".\ni took this to a outdoor concert in LA (besame mucho) and it was very cold and windy because of concert rules only small see through bags were allowed so i brought this jacket in its drawstring bag and took a very small amount of space and was perfect for the situation kept me warm through the whole night night. had very large outside pockets with zipper closures and very deep inside pocket behind the outside zip up ones, they seam to share the space keep this in mind when placing bulky items one side will use space from the other even thought they are separate a pocket . the hoody does not have draw strings but i dont feel needs them i think we have gotten use to everything needing drawstrings, it is a bit spacious inside the hood i guess if you have a beanie or a baseball style cap it should fit fine and extends just before the bill of cap. i just hated that they tried to ship it in no box just a clear see through bag the first time had to return arrived damaged.\nIn new condition its durability is uncertain until this point it has held up (2months), not sure yet the feel is not the toughest it has a thin feel but notably i have not torn it and it has at least been through the wash once keep in mind i airdried all this said it looks brand new and is in great shape , i would whole heartedly recommend this jacket just look for the deals also get the vest for an added layer of warmth"

				"reviewTitle": " Runs a little big but does a good job of being a lightweight jacket",
				"review": "The main purpose of a lightweight jacket is to keep you warm when it's cool outside but not super cold. For me that means I purchased this jacket for temps between 35 and 60. I wouldn't want to rely on it any colder than that. For that purpose, it does extremely well. I don't feel too hot wearing it in the upper 50s, and as long as I don't spend hours outside when it's in the 30s, it keeps me warm.\n\nMy only knock is that the sizing feels like it is from 20 years ago when everything was a bit more loose fitting. That's good if you want to layer up, but the styling is not the current trend of slim/ form fitting. Since I'm an older guy now, that's not as important to me, but it may be for others."

A size down would’ve been better, but there’s nothing wrong with a little extra space for layering. (I’m not doing any fashion shows). My comfort is my priority.\n\nThe jacket feels good on. It’s light weight.\nIt stores nicely into the sack provided and comes out wrinkle-free. It allows for a sufficient/confortable heat and is rain resistant (in a light rain). I tested it out today.\n\nOverall, I am VERY VERY happy with this jacket. I’m glad I bought it.\n\nI only wish I had another one to alternate between colors."

Very pleased with this jacket. I did order a size up and I'm glad I did. I typically wear an XL, but I ordered an XXL so I can wear it over thicker hoodies and sweaters and I'm glad I did. I don't think the XL would be as comfortable over bulky layers. The XXL is almost too big though, I wish there was like a 1.5 or something. But I'm still very happy with it. It's a higher quality jacket than I was anticipating. It's very lightweight and packs up super small when you need it to. If you're looking for a quality jacket for chilly weather, you won't be disappointed."

				"reviewTitle": " Great Versatile Jacket on Grand Canyon Backpacking Trip",
				"review": "Took a risk on this budget jacket as a lightweight warm layer option during a three day Grand Canyon November backpacking trip. Setting out, I wore frog toggs on top of this jacket as a water resistant layer as we descended the south rim in a “winter mix” as one ranger referred to it, a sideways barrage of freezing rain and hail. We were moving at a good pace with 40lb packs, but this jacket kept me at a perfect temperature for all days of the hike. At night, I wore it to bed in a 20-degree sleeping bag and it kept me toasty as overnight temps were near freezing. I thought it might be a single use type of product, but I continue to wear it as a primary option out and about when I want to stay warm. I’ll likely take it on another trip and will happily do so. I wouldn’t trust it in a downpour, but it can take a short, light sprinkle without issue. Zipper is higher quality than expected, hood is prefect, comes with a small stash bag."

The hood does not have a zip code to tighten around the face. The main zip slider is strangely on the left. It slides easily.\nBut this is a very comfortable jacket. Well worth the price. I ordered one size larger as my arms are longer than what it should be. So it fits slightly loose on the chest.\nOverall I like the jacket. Would recommend to others."

Both were cheap, flimsy, not thick at all for any sort of cold weather activity.\n\nTell me, in that photo I attached, can you tell me which one is the Haellun Men's Jacket?"

Has a little wiggle room too in case you have a little more meat on your bones than I do but I am genuinely happy with this! The fit is great and its a very comfortable and warm jacket. Now do be aware the patches just say “fashion” which I think is hilarious. When someone wearing high-dollar stuff asks what brand it is, you can just say, “oh, youre arent familiar?” And just walk away. Or take them off and put your own on. Either way, a nice jacket.

				"review": "My wife and I are headed from Phoenix to NYC for our first trip to see our son who moved there in April. You may imagine that, living in the desert, we don't have a wealth of cold weather clothes and I was in dire need of a good warm coat.\nThis looked like it would fit the bill and the price was great, so I took the plunge. Wow, am I ever pleasantly surprised!! This is a 'mid-weight' coat (think Mama bear), but once I had it on, there was no doubt it was going to do the job.\nThe lining is very comfortable and undoubtedly warm. The construction is sturdy and the zipper is industrial class. The warmer pockets are roomy, the hood (lined with the same 'fur' as the jacket) is very comfortable and has draw strings to make it snug in the wind. Additionally, the hood zips off if you don't happen to need it at the moment.\nI can't tell yet if it's wind proof and water resistant as the manufacturer claims, but given that the rest of the description is 'on target', my guess is that it will be.\nI usually wear a large, but the comments led me to believe I should step down a size which I did. They were right. I ordered a medium and there's still enough room for bundling up inside the coat.\nBottom line....a really well made, great, comfortable coat for a great price!"

I was also concerned that the jacket would be flimsy like a windbreaker and/or cheap looking fabric. So glad I took a chance! The color is even better than expected, in different lighting color almost looks like a very light tan as you can see from my second photo I compared it to a medium shade of grey t-shirt. Fabric is so nice, it took 15 minutes to steam out the wrinkles from packaging, jacket is very well constructed, medium to heavy weight with the fur lining inside arms too. Love that hood is removable and cuffs are adjustable. Ordered an X- large for 190pounds, 5'10\" as he has long torso and will want to wear sweatshirts underneath for extra warmth, fit is perfect! Fantastic quality, price and shipping was less than 2 days. So very happy I chose the right jacket, you won't be disappointed!"

I ordered an XXL (I'm 6'2 265 pounds) and it fits plentiful with room to layer up underneath it. (I think am XL would've fit me fine as well). Upon first two times wearing the jacket, it left a bunch of fuzzies on my shirt but after that it was fine. I love the jacket and I will be buying another color for a backup jacket"

				"review": "This is a GREAT HOODIE !!! Many of the photos in the reviews scared me with the stitching torn out of the sleeves & being marked as irregulars. It may be some retailers are pushing fake Carhartt merchandise or irregular merchandise. BUT, BUT, BUT I ordered mine from  fulfillment & carefully examined it when I received it. Mine was PERFECT !!! Even though I purchased the midweight hoodie, this is a fairly heavyweight hoodie. It seems to be sized one size different from the actual size - that is, I ordered an XL and it is almost perfectly the same size as my other XXL hoodies when I lay them overtop each other. This is EXACTLY what I expected & I ordered accordingly. So, the fit for me was PERFECT !!! (I am 5'9\" & 190 lbs). Also, I know this hoodie is a 50/50 cotton blend which normally wouldn't shrink, but I washed it with warm water & medium dryer heat & it shrunk just a tiny bit, but I was really hoping it would. The material seemed to just \"tighten-up\" a bit after washing - just enough when it came out of the dryer it was the same size as my all cotton XXL hoodies that I washed it with. Great hoodie - I highly recommend it - I also highly recommend that you order from Amazon Fullfillment."

No problem I thought, I would be able to send it back & get a refund as normal being a regular buyer on , but no, because it was shipped from Germany the seller insisted I sent it back to them which would have been a right rigmarole for me as I’m disabled & used to Amazon Prime’s service where Hermes collect items from my home if I need to send anything back to Amazon. Beware of sellers from abroad if you’re sent faulty items as you could end up with hassle & risks sending stuff back. Grrr!!!"

The logo on the sleave is not stitching it's that rubber glue melted onto the fabric, and to top it off I can litterally feel the edges of the pockets coming loose so I wouldnt carry anything heavy in there or put the weight of your hands inside them.\nAnd I wouldnt get it in XL because its more like XXXXL."

Just something for cold mornings but easy to stash when the day warms up. I picked this jacket because of the cost, to be honest. $15?? I figured it would be thin and cheap but if he lost this one too, no great loss. What a surprise when it arrived. A nice mid-weight fleece, heavy duty zipper, looks good, and looks like something I paid a lot more for. He's even hanging on to this one and hasn't lost it yet! Highly recommend!11"

The one I'm wearing in the picture is a medium size, which is comfortable but still a little too long for use with an outer shell-type bicycling jacket. I also purchased a small in a different color (forest green), but it is slightly tight in the stomach -- and still too long!\n\nThe camo colored one (medium size) is made in Vietnam.

I’m also impressed with its comfort and zippered pockets. The pockets are really useful because they are deep pockets. So if you put your phone in one and forget to zip it up, you don’t have the feeling that anything will slip out of your pocket as you bend over to pick something up off the floor (like I do 300 times a day with my four y/o daughter)"

But the huge pockets inside have not sewn on purpose. I don't know why. The other brand of jackets with big pockets never have the issue like this.\nDon't put your cell phone inside the big pocket.\n\nSuggestion to Amazon: Please sew the pockets completely."

The first one that I purchased was in a regular size (not tall) and the fit was nice enough for me to wear holes in but the sleeves were a little on the short side. If I extended my arms out in front of me, the cuff of the sleeve would miss my wrist by about 4 inches. So with this purchase, I decided to account for that issue and I ordered a Tall size...now the cuff of the sleeves are like 5 inches too long. The rest of the fit is great, but the sleeve length needs to be dialed in a little better.\n\n(FYI, I'm only 6'1\" but I usually by Tall when ordering shirts)"

				"review": "Mi piacciono le camicie e le giacche sportive a quadrettoni e quando ho notato questa giacca in pile della serie AMAZON ESSENTIALS, con delle caratteristiche in descrittiva che erano interessanti, ho deciso di acquistarla per utilizzarla in campagna nelle nostre zone collinari, anche durante le escursioni con i miei cani.\n\nLa giacca arriva in una busta trasparente perfettamente piegata e non appena rimosso il capo ho potuto subito constatare una apprezzabile QUALITA' complessiva della giacca tutto sommato discreta, pur sempre proporzionata alla caratteristica economica del prodotto.\n\nConsiderando che siamo infatti difronte ad una GIACCA in PILE di fascia economica e piuttosto sportiva, non mi è dispiaciuta la scelta del tessuto integralmente sintetico (100% poliestere) che sebbene si percepisce subito risulta comunque sufficientemente morbida e piacevole sulla pelle.\n\nApprezzabile ho trovato anche il suo CONFEZIONAMENTO sufficientemente curato ed attento ai particolari, come entrambe le TASCHE esterne con CHIUSURA a CERNIERA, la ampia TASCA INTERNA aperta e l’ELASTICO ai POLSINI, senza trascurare la CERNIERA LAMPO FRONTALE, che però presenta l’unico “difetto” di essere al contrario, ovvero al femminile, scelta che ammetto non ho compreso e che in alcune circostanze mi procura qualche rallentamento nella chiusura.\n\nA proposito della CERNIERA LAMPO, non si tratta di una marca nota YKK come indicato in alcune recensioni, ma in questa colorazione rosso-bisonte è una più economica che però svolge egregiamente il suo compito, con innesti sufficientemente precisi e scorrimenti fluidi in apertura come in chiusura, peccato solo per il montaggio al contrario a cui molti dovranno abituarsi.\n\nMi è piaciuta invece la tonalità del TESSUTO a QUADRETTONI rosso/blu dallo stile vagamente nord americano, con un PESO medio ed una sufficiente morbidezza, che mi ha piacevolmente sorpreso per il CALORE che garantisce, perfetto per la stagione fredda in arrivo.\n\nConsiderando inoltre la economicità di questo pile, trovo comunque gradevole il confezionamento della giacca, senza evidenti difetti e con quel colletto alto chiudibile con la cerniera lampo fin sotto il mento, per una linea complessiva piacevole che gli conferisce una certa personalità e carattere.\n\nIl TAGLIO è ovviamente sportivo ed indovinando la propria TAGLIA corretta, la VESTIBILITA' risulta comunque discreta.\nNeppure le MANICHE le ho trovate abbondanti in lunghezza come a volte accade ed avendo seguito le indicazioni in descrittiva ho scelto correttamente la M.\nSi tratta di una MISURA che per me che normalmente indosso giacche taglia 48 è risultata corretta, senza abbondanza ma una apprezzabile comodità, che mi permette di vestire il PILE con sotto anche una camicia, una polo o comunque un ulteriore capo.\n\nDopo aver considerato attentamente le misure indicate in descrittiva, come da altri evidenziato suggerisco di valutare di acquistare una TAGLIA IN MENO a quella che normalmente si è abituati a vestire, si tratta infatti di un capo che veste largo e non ho neppure riscontrato la vita stretta come segnalata nelle descrizioni.\n\nNel cercare di offrire dei riferimenti i più precisi possibili in relazione alle MISURE della TAGLIA M da me ordinata, se vado a misurare la giacca a riposo su un appendiabiti, i valori che posso confermare sono:\nTORACE (solo frontale) 54.5 cm, SPALLE 43 cm, VITA (solo frontale) 52 cm, MANICA 65 cm da fine spalla a polsino.\n\nLa giacca si indossare bene, non lega, non vincola nei movimenti, consentendo di vestire sotto ancora un ulteriore capo non troppo aderente come una camicia.\nIl capo infatti non stringe ne a vita come neppure sulle spalla e garantisce quel calore che potrà migliorare il comfort quotidiano durante i primi abbassamenti di temperature di fine autunno - inizio inverno, pur non essendo eccessivamente spesso.\n\nLe CUCITURE e quindi il confezionamento del tessuto, risultano discrete e sempre in linea con la tipologia sportiva/economica del capo, un pile che comunque non stona abbinato ad un paio di pantaloni sportivi, anche dei semplici jeans, per una abbigliamento molto informale e pratico che trovo apprezzabile nella nostra zona collinare di campagna, ma anche da utilizzare semplicemente in giardino o durante le escursioni con i nostri cani.\n\nNel complesso mi sento quindi di promuovere questa giacca della serie AMAZON ESSENTIALS, per le caratteristiche complessive del capo, acquistato a fine ottobre 2022 al PREZZO di 12.45 euro nella taglia M color ROSSO BISONTE, un costo che ritengo equilibrato.\nL'ultima verifica che andrà fatta è la reazione del tessuto dopo i primi lavaggi, ma è probabile che valuterò di acquistare altre colorazioni più classiche.\n\nIn quanto alla spedizione e consegna da parte di , sono state anche in questa circostanza efficienti e puntuali grazie al servizio Prime.\nMi auguro che questa recensione possa essere di aiuto e se avete dubbi o quesiti non esitate a chiedere."

				"review": "This may not be the best fleece jacket you will ever own, but it could well be the best value for money. Fleece is a fairly basic material that is reasonably warm, highly breathable and fairly light weight, compared to say wool. However it offers almost no protection against wind or rain so is best suited to being worn as a mid layer.\nThis jacket offers almost no frills e.g. no shoulder or elbow reinforced patches, no 2 way zip and not even a hem cord with cord locks. However most of these features merely add weight and cost and provide very little benefit in the real world.\nUltimately what really matters are decent materials, good quality construction and accurate sizing and happily this jacket is very good when it comes to these criteria.\nOverall this jacket provides good warmth, from a mid weight material, being around twice the weight of a micro fleece fabric. It fits me very well and the slightly elasticated cuffs and hem are sufficient to keep out any draughts. There are two hand warming outer pockets with zips and additionally 2 large inside “poacher” pockets big enough for a Ordnance Survey map but much more likely to be used for a hat or light weight windproof shirt/waterproof smock. The poacher pockets also provide a useful double layer of insulation, like wise the collar also has double thickness of material\nIf worn under a Goretex type jacket you may miraculously find that the jacket suddenly becomes far less leak prone. This is because around 99% of the moisture inside the jacket is not in fact rain coming in, but sweat that cannot get out, but can be managed very effectively by the fleece."

So you need an obliging lady with needle and thread to fix this first before you lose your stuff. Otherwise, an OK fleece, with two front zip pockets, rather loose fit on the chest, but good value for money."

My sizes are 3x & 2x. The 100% cotton version is only version for me. Not stretchy. My chosen sizes are room enough and movement is zero problems. Final thought, the cotton weight is medium to light heavy. Perfect feel for durability proven wear for work or just because you look so good in an authentic Levi trucker jacket."

I like the hoodie style and the arms have that sweatshirt stretch feel.\n\n-Just in case go a size up if you think jacket will be tight, For reference I compared it to my normal levi's medium denim, and this hoodie version feels much more comfortable, from eyeing both they look the same size, minus the hood on this one I bought.\n\nI am 5'6 male with medium build.\n\ntag says made in china\n\nno issues with delivery\n\nI already know which levi's i'll buy next."

				"review": "Pros:\n1) This jacket is great at trapping your body heat! Great for Fall and Winter.\n2) Looks good\n3) Fits\n4) Good casual wear for regular outings\n5) Good at blocking wind.\n\nCons:\n1) The textile used to make the zippers are indeed delicate. Will tear if you're brutish with it otherwise it's okay. It's about 1 tier below regular zippers we're all used to.\n2) Can tear if you're wearing this jacket for high activity outings like skiing etc.\n3) The first few minutes after donning the jacket and stepping outside may be a bit chilly (winter season) until you warm it up with your body heat. Like I said it's great at trapping heat.\n\nPro tip: After measuring the size to fit; buy 1 size larger. I had to return my first jacket b/c it fits too damn well; exposing the shape of my beer belly. My second one was 1 size larger (still fits) and that is where I gave it my 5 stars. And no you don't see my tummy."

				"review": "Quality is great. Inner lining is great. Color is great (I got blue).\n\nIt fits a little large on me. Some reviews said it fit a bit small. (Especially on the other Wrangler one like this with no hood)... I was worried I was going to have to get an XL. I got a large and it's a bit huge on me. No worries because I'm currently bulking up. (I'm 6ft tall and 210lbs) However, it makes me wonder how much shrinking I can expect from washing it. Normally I'm about 170 lbs and probably would've still taken a chance on Large... but apparently I would've been swimming in it. Even as it stands, it makes me look like I'm almost 300lbs because it's quite big.\n\nI also wondered (based on another review) if the color would be faded... but the blue is nice and vibrant.\n\nIt's a LOT more like a jacket than a regular hoodie. Partly due to the sort of quilted inner lining, partly due to how big and warm and cozy it is I guess. If it's around 0 degrees I can get away with just this plus t-shirt under, no REAL winter jacket/coat.\n\nLike some other options out there, the design for this one could've probably benefited from an inner zipper and then the buttons... and of course some dudes would prefer snaps instead of buttons.\n\nLady loves it. I'm impressed with it. It's warm. Pockets are useful."

				"review": "I bought one to try as I wear allot of this style outerwear and my current inventory is getting fairly old/worn. I'd say fit and finish is excellent on the jacket received. It's warm, blocks wind well and fit true to sizing for the most part (I ordered XL as I usually wear). the extra pockets take some getting used to but do come in handy.\nI only have two minor grips:\n1) The zipper pull is on the left side as is common with woman's clothing. I knew this going in as it's clearly advertised but it doesn't make it any less annoying every time I put the garment on/off.\n2) The arms are 2-3' too long and I believe they are designed that way given the have thumb slots so you can wear them down over your hands somewhat. (This also seems like a woman's clothing feature.) It's not bad but it is noticeable.\nAll in all, I had hoped to order a couple of more of these to keep around but those two minor issues will keep me shopping for another brand."

It's not a winter jacket (unless you live somewhere where it doesn't get cold). No surprise there.\n\nNow for the rest:\nArms are long\nThe thumb hole things are really small, not really useful... but are they really anyway?\nZipper on the left side?\nHood..not sure what the intent was but its big, and odd shaped, like it was supposed to fit over helmet or something.\nI don't understand the visor feature, it's floppy, and makes a great sail that pulls the hood back when it's windy.\n\nI don't hate it, I bought it for an inner layer so it works good for that. If You're looking for something marginal, at a decent price this is it.\nIf you want some great quality with great features..maybe this isn't it"

The hemming on sleeves and waist are nice though so it fits well there.\n\nThe pockets and zippers and buttons give the jacket a nice personality which I why I picked this one to begin with. The inside is very comfortable and will you keep you warm for anything but the coldest weather.\n\nThe inside jacket pockets will fit your phone at then some.

				"review": "I never bought clothes online but this turned out to be homerun. It fits perfectly. I am 5'8 with an average build 160lbs, and purchased the Medium. I'm very satisfied with the feel of the fabric. The outside is rugged but the inner jacket is soft and very comfortable. The collar portion can be laid flat or popped a little just like in the picture. It has a militaristic look, which I like. There are deep, inside-pockets on both sides (about as wide as your average wallet but deep as a bottle of beer), you can stuff anything about the size of a 1-liter bottle of soda on either side. At first I wasn't keen on the scrunchy-wrist-band style, but it really isn't that noticable and keeps cold air out. I have to admit, I am fairly impressed by this jacket and suprised it only cost $40. It's the type of jacket I would have bought at a department store for double the price and still think I got a good deal. I did get lucky that it fit perfectly though, others may not be as lucky."

				"review": "Wasnt 100% sure what to expect. Especially since I have a very difficult time shopping for clothes.\nWas very happy with it though. Fits me as perfectly as I could hope for. It says lightweight, but I would not consider this lightweight. More in the medium range.\n\nThe amount of light and the colour of light that hit this jacket definitely make a big difference in how its viewed. When I was opening it inside I almost thought I got the wrong colour. Until I took it outside.\n\nFor $40 though you can't really go wrong with this jacket if it is your style. The zipper above the pocket is just a useless zipper. Not an actual pocket. Purely aesthetic. Both inside pockets are a good size. They fit my Pixel 4 XL, with case and still have a bit room."

				"reviewTitle": " Great look/Subpar Quality",
				"review": "I brought this jacket for my grandson who hates wearing jackets and will only wear hooded sweatshirts, but since purchasing this jacket he loves it. Its a perfect balance for him he hates wearing extremely heavy jackets, but yet I wanted something that would keep him warm so it’s perfect. Oh and it looks very stylish too. I will definitely buy this item in other colors for my grandson as needed. Update 2/7/2022 I love the look of the jacket but having it only for less than 2 months I noticed that the zipper teeth started getting jammed and falling off. I took the jacket to the tailors to replace the zipper and they refused to replace the zipper due to the placement of the snaps, the tailor said it would mess up the integrity of the garment and it wouldn’t be worth the cost. So I am now stuck with a great looking jacket that doesn’t s zip. Subpar quality in the making of this product buyer beware."

				"review": "Received this product today. First impressions: the quality is very good. It was a little loose for a “medium” (I’m 5 foot 9 inches, 73 kg/160 lbs) but that’s just fine as it allows for a sweater to be worn underneath in the growing colder weather of southern Ontario, Canada. The side pockets are roomy and perfect to keep your hands warm. The four pockets on the chest are great to have but a bit small considering the growing size of cell phones. My 6.5 inch screen phone would not fit in any of them so I would relegate them to holding wallets, keys, change, glasses. The inner chest pocket is however roomy and holds my phone & wallet easily. The outer shell is decent. I got the black which is very deep in colour. Our temperature is in the upper teens (celcius) and it’s fine with just a t-shirt underneath. I took a chance and this turned out to be a good buy."

				"reviewTitle": " Has multiple heat zones, good construction, fits small",
				"review": "I was fortunate enough to read a couple other reviews which hinted at this jacket running a bit smaller so I ordered an XL when I normally wear a size Large. That was a good move because it fits me perfectly. This jacket looks like a normal winter coat except for the space age LED logo on the left breast area. the LEDs can be turned off but they are useful at first to see what zones are active and what their setting is. There's a setting for front, back, arms, and the neck/hood area, all individually controllable with different temperature settings.\n\nThe heat works great and stays on for a while then turns itself off automatically and you stay warm since the heat stays trapped inside the jacket. This is probably going to offend someone but I get the feeling that this jacket is made more for mild climates where people think they are cold but it's actually like 50 degrees outside. Where I live in the mountains, it's extremely cold in the winter which presents a problem when using a jacket like this. I've noticed when wearing several layers, which is what you do when it's very cold, you don't always feel the warmth of this jacket since the other layers are keeping the heat out as much as it keeps the cold from you as well. So this works best when worn with something thin like a T shirt and maybe a thin sweatshirt underneath. That said, it's still useful with layers, but you won't notice the heat as much.\n\nThe jacket is powered by what appears to be a standard 5V USB power bank that is included and fits perfectly in the little pouch built into the jacket. I tested another one I had and it works fine, so if the original power bank fails, it's nice to know the jacket isn't completely useless. I've been using this jacket for about a month now and the battery pack works fine. I've had to charge it about every 3 times I wear it for extended periods, it's easy to remove and charge, just like any other USB power pack.\n\nI did want to mention that the packaging for this jacket is very nice, and it looks and feels like a high quality product. The construction is good and aside from the size being off, I really don't have any complaints about it. The various heat zones is a great feature and is especially useful if you find that one part of your body is colder than the others, so you aren't burning up in one area and cold in another. It's a nice jacket and I've been using it on medium cold days but to be honest, I'm still using my Patagonia jacket with a couple other layers when it's below 0 and I've been just fine with that. I do like the novelty of this heated jacket and I find myself wanting to wear it more than I was expecting when I first tried it on."

I ordered a size up based on the  suggestion, but when it arrived it was too big and it fit over my normal winter coat with room to spare. When I tried to exchange it, even though it is a product shipped and sold by Amazon, the price changed by more than $30 and Amazon wouldn’t help beyond offering a $10 credit - which would mean I was still going to have to spend $20 more than what I initially spent.\n\nOverall, the jacket seems really nice and I’m going to miss not having it probably.

As another person commented, this is a great fit for us plus size women who don’t have many options in the way of jackets and Columbia has limited plus sizes for women. This is really intended as just a rain jacket/wind breaker- not thick enough to provide much warmth (but that’s not the intention). Adjustable hood with cords that are designed in a loop so they don’t pull out. Zipper and Velcro closure provides double protection. Velcro wrist closures allow to be tightened at the wrist. Great color options. Ordered the 4x which gives some room for thicker shirts underneath."

Unfortunately it isn't very breathable and it doesn't have pit zips so you end up getting very damp and sweaty, as a waterproof jackets job is to keep you dry I find it to be counter productive. If you were doing a low intensity stroll (around the shops or walking with young children) then it is perfectly fine. I have kept it as a backup jacket.\nThe Columbia evaPOURation jacket is far better than the Watertight II as it is breathable and has pit zips, but it does lack the comfortable mesh lining."

				"reviewTitle": " Plus-size women: Read this review",
				"review": "One of the frustrating things about being an active plus-size woman, particularly one that carries a substantial amount of weight in the chest or belly, is the near-total lack of high-quality technical gear available for purchase. Most companies assume that if you’re overweight, you must not go outside in inclement weather, and most certainly not to *gasp* exercise! As many plus-size people out there know, many of us do both, and many of us are committed to improving or restoring our health, be it from weight-gain due serious injury or illness, or from simply choosing a healthier path in life. (Both happen to apply in my case.)\n\nThe problem as a woman, however, is the extremely limited range of plus sizes in high-quality technical gear. Columbia is one of the only brands to have plus-sizes at all, but even theirs only go up to a 3X for women. And, unfortunately, their 3X is more like a 1X-2X in other plus-size brands like Penningtons. That leaves women over 240 lbs out in the cold (literally and figuratively).\n\nHowever, plus-size women, there is hope. I ordered this Columbia men’s plus-size jacket in 4X and it was the equivalent of a women’s 4X at Penningtons. Just as important (and rather surprising): the sleeves are not excessively long like most men’s jackets. They’re only slightly too long for my arms (about an inch) which is easily dealt with by using the Velcro straps.\n\nThe rest of the jacket is equally well-proportioned. While it doesn’t hug the hips in a feminine way, it’s not bulky or pouchy in other areas, and easily passes as a unisex or women’s jacket in my opinion.\n\nAs expected from Columbia, the jacket materials are superb. The jacket is very lightweight, waterproof, breathable, and exceptionally comfortable. It’s infinitely more comfortable and higher-quality than any of the plus-size department store-brands I tried, and it’s about 40% less expensive.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone who is plus-size and desires excellent outdoor gear."

It was still big enough to he able to have a t shirt and a hoodie underneath. The big & tall is 2inch longer in the length which I like more.\nThe 2xl did fit but I felt it was big. When I grabbed the jacket in the middle of my chest and pulled out there was 5 to 6 inches of extra room. The sleaves felt really baggy and it was barely at waist height.\n\nIf your unsure about sizing order both and see. The 1xl b&t was slimmer fitting while being a little longer as I'm 6'.\nThe 2xl felt too big and boxy. More suited for a bigger dude who's sorter then myself."

				"review": "So to start, I was looking for a winter/fall\nJacket that would be used on milder weather days during the winter and late fall months ( around +5C to -10C). I already have a proper winter jacket but it dosent make sense to wear a jacket that’s rated up to -30C on days where it’s -5C outside as it would be overkill in my opinion. I saw great reviews on YouTube and  for Carhartt and at first I bought an XXL because I wanted a little extra room (I’m a size XL) to be able to layer up if necessary however this jacket (and it does NOT mentioned on the tag in the pictures put up on Amazon) was a “Loose Fit”! As a result, the jacket felt more like a 3XL or 4XL. I ended up exchanging it for an XL “Loose fit” which fit more like a XXL because I wanted the extra room but I’m certain that if I got a large it would have been form fitting. All in all, I love it! It’s a little stiff but as it breaks in, I’m sure this thing will feel more like a sweater than a jacket which is dangerous because I’ll run the risk of wearing it all the time haha. Otherwise it’s a good buy in my opinion but I don’t think that it will be as protecting against the cold on a day where it’s -30C outside."

Mind you this is no fancy-mans jacket. Tough as nails you actually feel protected. The zipper is HEAVY duty. I’m 5’10” 170 lbs and the medium is perfect. It is loose as said but I wear a sweater. Temps right now are about -15c/ 5F. The hood seems built for wearing a hat or helmet under for sure—it’s shallower then I like but it warm and cozy. It’s pretty much everything people say it is, and it’s made in the USA which is great by me being Canadian. If you think you don’t want one, you are just wrong! I think it’s very well priced for the quality."

Plenty of non conspicuous pockets. Repels light rain. I’m 5’10” and weigh 165 pounds. Slim build with somewhat broad shoulders, long torso and arms. The medium gives me a perfect, leaning towards roomy fit in the chest area. Perfect length at waist and arms. Make sure it has the London Fog label as one of mine was a different jacket.  corrected that quickly and the other four I purchased were correct. If interested in the yellow, the pics are confusing showing it as bright yellow and another pic shows more of a light beige color. Mine was a very nice pale yellow. The pink is very pale as well. I don’t normally wear much pink but this very pale pink is nice. Doesn’t scream PINK. Also have the black, green and beige matching the display pictures. Excellent price for such quality."

				"reviewTitle": " Excellent light jacket",
				"review": "In my area it's only really cold a few days of the year. While I own several coats and jackets that keep me warm during those few times, they are too warm the rest of the time. I needed something light, something to keep off a chill while holding off the wind and the occasional light mist. Enter two great choices: The London Fog Auburn Jacket and the Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket. Both jackets were available from  at reduced prices so I bought both. The bottom line is I like both and I'm keeping both. Both are similar and both are winners. My advice is to buy based on color and cost because you can't really lose.\n\nThe Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket differs from the Auburn Jacket by having knit cuffs and bottom edge. The Auburn Jacket has elastic in the bottom edge and the cuffs snap closed. I have no preference either way. The outer fabric of both is microfiber polyester (whatever happened to poly/cotton twill, I wonder). Both feel like the same weight and look like they could have been cut from the same bolts of cloth except for the colors. The liners are a little different with the Weatherproof being slightly heavier but in no way bulky or thick. The Auburn has a lighter feeling fabric inside. Again, I have no preference either way. Fit-wise they are very much alike. The Weatherproof is a little longer in the body than the Auburn when the Auburn is bought in standard sizes. Personally, I probably should have gotten the tall size of the Auburn but reviews indicated the Auburns sleeves are a bit too long and tall sizes usually have even longer sleeves. I'm almost exactly six feet tall with a long torso so I can usually go either standard or tall without either seeming off. I ordered the Auburn in standard length and it's okay but just a tad short. However, I wouldn't want the sleeves to be any longer. The Weatherproof fits me perfectly in length and the sleeves are okay too--not as long as those on the Auburn. I ordered XXL in both jackets and I cannot detect any difference in the fit around the chest or waist. They're roomy enough in my case for wearing a heavy sweater if need be. I've worn them with thick sweatshirts but nothing heavier.\n\nI've worn both jackets in 45F weather but not in the rain. Both cut the wind well. I don't expect either to be waterproof like my Eddie Bauer rain parka. Probably fine for a light mist or a quick shower. What I find so great about these jackets is that they're comfortable over a wide range of temperatures. I can wear one while driving without having to deal with the bulk of a heavier coat and I can wear it indoors for extended periods without feeling overheated. Even on cold days, I usually only need a jacket for those times I'm outdoors between buildings or from the car to a building. I only need a really warm coat when I'm outside for more than a few minutes.\n\nWhich to buy? Both are great. I have a tan London Fog Auburn and a light blue Weatherproof Classic Golf. Both colors will coordinate and match with other colors fine. The London Fog has more color choices here on Amazon so that might be a factor. My decision was made based on price. At the time I bought both jackets, the prices were at a low point and both jackets were bargains.\n\nEDIT 01/18/2019:\n\nI've worn both these jackets for a while now and I have to give the edge to the London Fog. That's based on a couple of things about the Weatherproof that wasn't evident at first. Mainly it has to do with the knit cuffs on the Weatherproof. In a very short time, they are beginning to pill on the right side of my jacket. I'm not sure this speaks well for the quality of the fabric for the longterm. Another thing I did not notice early on is that the cuffs on the Weatherproof do not match. The left cuff's knit is different from the right. This might explain the pilling of the right cuff. However, I admit I like the way the knit cuffs fit compared to the snap cuffs of the London Fog. On the London Fog, the cuffs feel either too tight or too loose, depending on which snap I use."

				"reviewTitle": " Different material and NOT black",
				"review": "Bought the heather gray zip-up from the same seller and it was a different material. This seems to be of a more \"crushed\", shorter fleece and not FULL fleece like the heather gray one I bought before. This isn't a big issue for me besides that the two items were advertised as the same. They definitely aren't. I can't tell whether this one is a knock-off or just a different Columbia garment altogether. Also I have seen arguments in the reviews whether or not this garment is actually black. Even being shiny, crushed-style fleece.. this doesn't look black at all, does it? It can't decide whether it wants to be charcoal gray or navy blue.\nOverall, it is a great garment. It's warm, soft, looks great dressed up or down - but the way it's presented here on  is a little misleading.\nI am 6' 0\", 181 lbs, wearing a size Large."

				"reviewTitle": " Bought Two of These...Odd sizing...Very nice and warm!!!",
				"review": "So I bought two of these fleece sweaters and both are made well and very warm. Style is comfortable and overall as expected. My only dilema is this. In black this fleece fits a bit snug, but pretty close to the average size large. The tag says large and what not. However I also bought the same fleece in Red and this one fits a bit larger almost like it were an extra large, but not quite as big. Still bigger and more roomy than the black. Again, both say large and all the tags seem correct. As for me, I'm pretty much small enough to wear a large, but also big enough to wear an extra large without it looking too huge. So, what am I to do? Do I keep both knowing one is a big more snug while the other is a bit more roomy? Who knows, but if you were to buy two of these that would be the only way to compare the different feels on these two fleece sweaters that are supposed to be identical in every way except the color. I'm keeping both because they are very comfortable, but again my dilema being the odd sizing between the two colors. I'm tempted to e mail columbia on the issue, but not sure what they will say. I may anyway and if so I will update this review later. Enjoy and keep warm...these fleece sweaters will serve you well.\n\nUPDATE: So I returned the smaller size of the black fleece and ordered an extra large one. I got one labeled \"L\" and fits like the red one which fit more like an extra large fleece. Basically in a nut shell, I'M DONE WITH COLUMBIA. Sizes and quality control cannot be trusted. The sweaters are nice in terms of the fabric, but everyone is making fleeces now. You can get a normally sized fleece at W@lmart and it would probably be more true to the labeled size than gambling on Columbia sizes. Between returning the products, shipping labels, inconvenience, I probably broke even or so had I just bought this retail and picked the size that fit me in person. If you want to gamble on what size you're actually going to get compared to the labeled product and what you actually ordered then by all means keep buying Columbia and figure it out on your own. I'd rate these fleeces at about a 2 stars only because I like the fabric, but its not worth the hassle because Columbia doesn't have their sizes or tags in order. Were these all just one big oops and being pawned off on  to clean house, or does Columbia care? Well, glad you asked because I contacted them and their best solution was to order one directly from them instead etc. Really? So if I bought a HONDA from a dealership and the car is all screwed up, then does that mean I have to go to Japan to get it squared away? What's the point? Funny, I used to work for HONDA and they made sure the cars were in order. On the other hand Columbia either cares about the products they are putting their NAME ON, or they don't. From my experience....they don't. You think they are going to issue a recall for these fleeces? NOPE. It's easier to sell them anyway and have people lose money, time, and convenience sending them back and forth to AMAZON because the sizes were screwed up in a factory overseas. I'm surprised  is still selling these with all of the conflicting reviews on the sizing. Sorry COLUMBIA, I own 3 products from you....you're OUT!! No more."

The only issue is that I bought the black one, and even though I've only washed it with the Woolite detergent meant for super delicate clothing, the black color immediately lightened, so it doesn't look that great now. If this jacket stayed a dark black, it would be perfect. Still, even with the color fading, I still wear mine."

There is a blueish tint to it.\nThe jacket is very warm but breathable, you can feel wind passing though the sleeves.\n\nI like that the front zipper pockets close going up so you can zip them up partially so things won’t just slide out but you can still access them.\nIt has big wide interior pockets too at the stomach area. And the packets are deep. Adjustable waist is nice too.\nOverall would recommend, worn it for about a month now."

It kept his ears covered, his head stayed warm, it had nice zipper pockets (one interior), wonderful inner lining, and folded down easy to fit back into our vacuum seal bag for our suitcase. The jacket has velcro and an interior zipper, the sleeves did have velcro to tighten around the wrist, and it covered his back pants pockets (he's 5'10\"). Perfect jacket for our upcoming ski trip also."

To be fair, the Eddie Bauer is over twenty years old and one of the Colombia jackets was ripped by a dogs claw. The zipper is a common point of failure on two of them. The zipper on this jacket seems secure. I am less enthused about the Velcro closures around the zipper, not a real fan of Velcro. This jacket is waterproof, helping to cut the wind. I appreciate the inner pocket for a wallet and a similar outer pocket for sundry items. Two large regular side pocket hold gloves, hat, keys, and any other items. I am happy with this purchase."

				"review": "Super warm. Warer resistant for sure. Looks just as shown in the pictures and sizing is pretty spot on. Most reviews around my hieght purchased mediums for the same weight bracket 150 lbs. I bought a large. Im 5'9\" @ 150 lbs. I like a slightly loose fit to my coats and this didn't disappoint. Length puts it just below my belt line. Shoulders have a little extra room, but not too much. Sleeves don't have fleece lining, but they are lined well and keep your arms warm wearing nothing more than a t-shirt under it. Sleeve length is great as well. Not short, not long. Hood is fleece lined. Left handed zipper. Its an amazing buy for anyone looking for a nice, warm, and comfortable winter coat. Don't hesitate to buy if you need an inexpensive coat without losing visual appearance. Sizing is pretty on point."

				"review": " This coat was bought for my 14 years old son and he loves it. There are 2 main pockets and a third smaller pocket in the front. And there is an inside pocket as well on the left side.\n\nThe body of the jacket and the removable hood is lined with warm fur-like fabric.\n\nThere is no adjustable elastic at the bottom of the jacket to prevent snow from going up the jacket. However, that being said, my son has been wearing this coat for 4 months now and he plays with his 3 younger brothers in the snow all the time and he has never had any issues with snow getting into his coat. He's worn it in -25C weather and wasn't cold at all.\n\nWhen asked what he loves about this coat, his answer is always the same. He says it is super comfortable to wear and it keeps him warm and toasty and the hood is not only big enough to protect his head but protects most of his face as well. Overall a great purchase. Would recommend.\n\nIf my review was helpful let me know by clicking on the ''Helpful'' button :) 👍🏻"

				"review": "Just to let you know, I ordered this in November to see if I could get away with a winter coat at the cheaper end of the market. I am only writing a review now because we have now had some cooler days here in Ottawa. Last week we had -18C [for those in the mediaeval states that still use Fahrenheit, that is -1F (or 33 degrees below freezing point)]. The \"Feels like\" temperature was -25C (which is -13F, or 45 degrees below freezing point). For those who don't experience these kind of temperatures, your eye lashes start to freeze together at that temperature, and your nose hairs freeze. In the wind, especially if your fingers or other extremities are wet and exposed, you risk frostbite. THIS COAT though kept me warm - with just a t-shirt and a cable knit cotton sweater underneath. It's the real deal - it works in very cold temperatures.\n\n(Waits patiently for someone from Winnipeg to come on and say I don't know what the word cold means because I live in Ottawa where the winters are 'warm' compared to Winnipeg...)\n\nUPDATE: Winter is almost done (It only lasted 18 months this year). I stand by my initial review, except to say if you live somewhere tropical like Britain, it will be way too warm for your winters. Great for -20C - -30C (For those countries still in the 18th century that is between -4F and -22F)."

				"review": "The jacket arrived on time and is a perfect fit. I ordered the XXL and am 6'3\" and approximately 280lbs (127Kg) and it just fits with a bit of room to spare. The arm length is good and zipping up the jacket with a smaller jacket underneath is done with no issue but not a lot of room to maneuver. Not tight but not overly loose either. I can also comment on the one user who said the zipper is flimsy. If you go hard at that zipper, it likely will break off. It is not rugged. If you calmly zip the jacket up, you will have no problem.\n\nI have walked with this jacket/smaller jacket combo in -7 Celsius with good warmth, even a little hot after 15 minutes. In 0 degree Celsius this is too hot. I live in the North where the temperature will get down to -50, with an average around -35 in the January - April months. I will do up an addition to this review when I have gone through a few days like that. Until then, this is a very good jacket for the money and so far, serving me well."

The first one I bought 3 years ago, and the second one I bought 2 years ago. They get worn every day 6 months of the year and are still going strong, with very minor pilling on the one I've had for 3 years. A very solid product."

				"reviewTitle": " Great Jacket, Tricky Sizing (imo)",
				"review": "Before purchasing this jacket I read as many reviews as possible on the sizing. When ordering clothes online we all want to avoid the pain of having to return them for a different size. One thing that stuck out to me was that people said the jacket runs big. I usually wear a medium in most shirts but with coats and jackets I usually get a large. I decided to go with the medium expecting it to fit more like a large based upon the reviews. I also have a Carhartt hoodie that is a medium and it’s pretty loose on me so the reviews that said it runs big seemed reasonable to me. I’m a 6 foot male with a 40 inch chest and I weigh 165lbs. I first put the jacket on over a t-shirt and it seemed a perfect fit but I would definitely not want it any smaller. The thing is I plan on this being my winter work coat and where I live it frequently gets 20 degrees Fahrenheit and below and I will need to add a layer or two underneath for the extra warmth. I tried the jacket on over a hoodie and it was just too tight and without enough range of movement for what I do so I returned it for a large. The large seems to be perfect on me with a hoodie underneath and it’s still not too big with just a shirt so I should be able to get more usage out of this jacket other than just the coldest winter months. The jacket itself is great quality. Triple stitching, tough materials, and draw strings on the hood and lower hem to customize the fit. I highly recommend this jacket and just about everything Carhartt makes. Hope my experience on the sizing is helpful. If you’re kinda in between sizes like I am maybe order the two sizes you fall between and keep the one that fits the way you want."

				"review": "I needed to replace my everyday coat when the zipper busted. I was tempted to buy a different coat at half the price which would have been adequate, but I've wanted a Carhartt for a while and decided to spend the extra for the Carhartt. I'm glad I did.\n\nFirst the delivery was optimal. I ordered it on a Thursday morning and it was delivered Friday afternoon by the time I got home from work.\n\nI cannot speak to the durability as I've only written it one time. But it feels substantial. It is definitely heavier than your average winter coat, so that probably speaks to the durability.\n\nIt was probably not cold enough in the morning when I put it on and I could have opted for a lighter jacket and been alright, but I was like a kid with a new toy, and it is very warm. By the afternoon it had warned up with sharp winds and it wasn't too warm.\n\nWith thick cuffs, and a bottom cinch chord this cost is windproof.\n\nThe pockets are great. There are two chest pockets, with snap closures, and one of these is a double pocket with a Velcro pocket. There are also two side pockets.\n\nThere are two internal pockets, one with a zippered closure that is large enough to accommodated my Moto Power G in a case so even in a downpour the phone will stay dry. The other internal pocket has a Velcro closure. So there will be plenty of room to keep your stuff.\n\nI've had knock off Carhartt coats before that lasted a year or two but I think the phrase often imitated never duplicated rings especially true for this cost"

				"review": "Alright, So it seems to me that there is a bit of uncertainty with the sizing of this jacket and I think I can clear that up.\n\nThere seem to be 2 types of buyers for this coat, those who buy it for working conditions with layering and maneuverability in mind, and those that buy it simply for the aesthetics that want a more snug, modern slim fit.\n\nAs someone, who is using this jacket for work with layering in mind I purchased an xl tall (labeled big and tall on the size selection). I am 6\"3 slim with shoulders on the broadside, this allows me to layer up,\nOn a typical day, I wear overalls, a cotton sweatshirt, and a thicker/heavier hoody underneath this jacket and still have some room to move comfortably. So if you are buying this for work, go with your typical workwear size, which for me typically is 36, 32-34 length pants and an XL top.\n\nNow if you want to wear this jacket to be stylish, going on about town or a hike or whatever, and you don't think you'll be wearing heavy layers, its probably safe to say you can size down If I were to wear this jacket to a pub or something during winter/fall I would probably get the large, tall, or maybe even a medium-tall If I didn't lack the self-discipline to get rid of my beer belly.\n\nIf you have a longer torso I recommend getting tall, which again is labeled Big Tall on the  drop link so that it covers your waist as it does appear to be styled as a waist line jacket. (There is no big AND tall for this model I confirmed with carhartt, its just an increase in length)\n\nI hope this is helpful and will clear up some of the sizing issues some of you are facing reading over the reviews and you can save yourself from the hassle of returns and exchanges"

It's tough to go by all these *cough* wonderful *cough* reviews.\nFor reference I wear large size t shirts from Walmart.\nI got an XL tall because L tall was sold out. The length of the coat is perfect but the sleeves are a bit long on me, I feel like the standard would have been too short on the coat as many have said, but the sleeves would have been better so pros and cons there. I'm not super tall but I wanted a longer coat.\nI would have preferred the large no doubt in my mind but I'm not swimming in the XL. It fits just how an XL jacket should fit. Next time I will get large, no biggie. Jackets are always going to be a bit bigger than t shirt sizes to allow for layering you silly people. Duh.\nThe material is nice and tough the lining is very nice. The zipper is good quality. The front pockets are for HANDS not GEAR(stuff will fall out sideways)\nThe strings to adjust the hood have an interesting design. The little beads you squeeze to choke up on the strings and keep them from moving are actually hidden inside the trim of the coat which is a classy little feature, they aren't swinging like every other coat out there. The gussets on the back of the shoulders allow full movement, you are not constricted in any way. The elastic in the cuffs is pretty tight but should loosen over time.\n\nOverall it's a fantastic jacket and I really have no real complaints. It's beautiful and built exceptionally well.\nI will have to see how long it will last. I'm a mason and work outside often in the winter so that will be a good test to the longevity of this coat and I will report back here when it receives damage for you guys.\n\nI have had bad experiences with Carhartt pants. The pants are so expensive and they did not last in my trade at all. Better off going dickies at half the price FOR PANTS that's just my opinion on that.\n\nI will be buying the Bartlett again 100%.\nAt the $174 I paid here on  I think I the quality surpasses the price."

				"review": "Sat on the fence in buying this for a while due to the conflicting reviews about sizing. IF you go by the sizing chart for this item, I'd suggest going down a size, as it doesn't match up. I'm in the UK, 5'10\", 15 stone, and an XL in everything (too many sweets, too little exercise), but according to the sizing chart I should've got an XXL. I took a punt, and ordered the XL. It fits great. Arm length size is fine, cost length is fine, and I could easily wear a hoodie underneath it and still do it up. It might be a little snug, and probably very warm, but I could. The Sherpa lining is only on the body and hood, the sleeves are lined with the normal shiny lining you get on some coats, but there is some kind of insulating between the lining and outer layer. It weighs quality, it's not a light jacket, which I like in a winter coat. There are elastic draw strings to tighten up the bottom of the jacket, and the hood just has a shoelace type draw cord. I've added some spring toggles to the hood cord, as if you did pull it tighter, it would otherwise not stay tight, unless you tied a pretty bow under your neck with both ends. No idea if I'll ever tighten it, but they're there if I want to. Overall very pleased with this jacket. Can't wait for winter to come so I can actually wear it. I had a similar coat years ago, which is by far the best coat I've ever had, but years of hard wearing have finally killed it (continuously looking for a replacement, hence why I bought this now). This coat is equally as good as that one from what I can tell. Bought it in Carhartt brown."

				"review": "I ordered one of the cheaper jackets on , and that didn’t turn out well, and returned, then found this and though I’m not a fan of Columbia(don’t get me started), at least I know the brand well, and found the orange-red chili color for twenty five but Amazon showed it would take a month to deliver(watch out when ordering), so I looked again and then saw the blue one for twenty nine and ordered. Came with a retail price tag of seventy five. Whatever all that means. Was looking for a cheap rain jacket that works, that was all. I’m a short guy at 5’4” and 165lbs, 41-42” chest, and usually wear a 31-32 waist. I ordered a medium and it feels exactly half a size larger, likely tailored just a tad larger to give room for layers underneath. Being short, I expected the sleeves to be long on me, but they weren’t egregiously so, and the Velcro holds at wrists so sleeve length doesn’t seem like a big problem. This isn’t exactly like a fitted jacket but half and half between a windbreaker style and old fashioned raincoat. It’s a bit baggy and roomy. The cut is rather “universal” and I wish was a bit more slim and flattering but this way will fit most body types. Not a big deal tho. It does have a packable pocket inside for packing the jacket into but I haven’t tried it since I want to keep the DWR intact as long as possible before my hiking trip and don’t want to wrinkle up severely beforehand. The packable pocket is vented netting which I imagine would be friendly for wet jackets though I still wouldn’t pack a wet jacket for more than a day cause mold. I haven’t tried the waterproofing either but I bought this for hiking and later monsoon seasons in Southeast Asia, and so I got a backup poncho anyways, and the jacket label says waterproof(look picture), so yeah, it ain’t one of those windbreakers that some salesman is trying to sell as a rain jacket. I’m sure it will be fine for my use. The craftsmanship and manufacturing seems very well done, and all in all, can say for sure for thirty bucks was a bargain. Happy with it, though I kinda did like that red chili color better. This is one of those rain jackets that scream, “hey don’t judge my baggy fit cause I’m a raincoat,” and the orange color fits that a bit better imo. Too bad orange wasn’t in stock when I ordered, but the blue looks good too. The jacket does look and feel quality for a lowly rain jacket. Thumbs up."

The hood fit great and because the liner is so thin, you can layer very nicely underneath it. The zipper however, was awful. It wouldn't go up and down with any ease and it felt like it was going to break or tear the fabric. Returned and grabbed another unit and it was the same thing. I have many Carhartt garments and if the zipper wasn't an issue on this, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it!"

				"review": "Well, I was hoping this would work as a winter coat for my husband up here in the Adirondacks of NY. And it most certainly does the job. It's super warm. He can't even wear it inside or in the car because he gets so warm. He loves the jacket though. Very soft and the dark blue is a great color for him. The dark blue has some gray in the embroidered logo on the front.\nI used it to shovel the other night and absolutely no wetness got through. The fabric sort of whisks it away. You don't need a big, bulky coat with this fleece."

				"review": "You can't go wrong with this brand as everything they produce is top quality. What I dislike with this purchase is the logo is not embroidered rather just a tag but it did state that in the listing that it would be either or. The second demerit is the color is more a burnt charcoal rather than true black. For the price I'll keep it as it's just a bum around in zippered fleece that'll serve it purpose well. I have another Steens zippered fleece that's at least 10 years old and still intact after a lot of abuse! The overall fit is great in XXL but my too big belly makes it slightly tight in that area."

				"review": "Have been looking for a lightweight rain jacket for golf at a reasonable price. Tried a couple of more expensive ones and wasn't real happy with them, it seems you either get lightweight or only water resistant, not waterproof. This one advertises water resistant but I was impressed with the material and expect it will hold up to a decent downpour. I have not had a chance to test it yet but the fabric is better than what I was expecting. I am normally a medium size for most things but ordered a large for this given I will use it for golf and the fit is great. It is lightweight and does not restrict movement. Not a fan of the brand logo on the chest but if all goes well I will only wear it a few times a year."

				"review": "I bought this jacket for my 14 years old son. He has worn it throughout fall 2020 and is already wearing it again this spring (April 2021). It is lightweight and very well-made. It has 2 regular side pockets in the waist area as well as a large zippered front pocket in which the jacket can be folded into. When wearing the jacket, this extra large pocket is very practical for storing your keys, cellphone, earbuds, and any other personal items. Even though the fabric is thin, it keeps you warm during cooler windy days. The quality is good as we have had no issues at all with the fabric ripping.\n\nIt fits my son nicely and has a little extra space which is great since he can easily wear layers underneath. It is adjustable at the waist and it is wind and rain repellent. The hood is also a nice touch and helps keep him dry when he is out and about. It's stylish, comfortable and the fact that it can be neatly folded into a compact little pouch is definitely a plus. Great purchase. Would recommend.\n\nIf my review was helpful let me know by clicking on the ''Helpful'' button :) 👍🏻"

Si tienen mucho músculo en el pecho y brazos y normalmente son Talla M mejor pidan la L, ya que si viene justa en esas área les puede llegar apretar un poco esas zonas.\nNo le puse las 5 estrellas porque la chamarra no tiene buena ventilación y el material no transpira, es como uno de esas sudaderas de plástico que usan los boxeadores para sudar, por lo que para actividades físicas como correr van a sudar mucho con ella, aunque eso sí, con mucho estilo."

				"review": "My ratty old ski jacket from 1990 was obviously in need of replacement so I bought this. When I opened it up and tried it on I was disappointed -- it was so light and thin I didn't really believe it would be effective, but since it fit, I didn't send it back and then a cold day came and I decided to try it outdoors. Well, it is quite warm. As warm as the old ski jacket used to be and it had real down (this jacket is \"insulated\" but it uses synthetic, imitation down.) I'm not sure I have as free motion as I did with the old jacket but then again I'm too old for the slopes now, I just want to be comfortable outdoors. And the hood, which I didn't think was important when ordering, turns out to be very effective too at keeping my head warm, although the hood tends to fall down over my face and reduce my field of vision. These are minor drawbacks. The biggest negative is the slick, plasticky surface that feels unpleasant where it touches my skin (wear a hat under the hood and a scarf around your neck, but thin ones because the jacket does the insulation job without any help). The variety and large size of the pockets are other big advantages -- you'll be carrying thick gloves in those pockets, maybe a balaclava, maybe a smartphone.\nI tried the jacket when it was 34 degrees F outside. Will it still be effective in 20? I guess I'll find out."

				"review": "I am 220 lbs and 180cm.\nNice fall or mild winter jacket. I purchased on sale for $54 Cdn, worth every penny.\nIf you plan on using as your main winter jacket, make sure you wear a sweater as well. I was outside in -5c with -14c wind chill and not being active, I could feel the cool air (maybe due to sizing. I normally wear XL but ordered XXL). Wearing the jacket walking in -5C with -11C windchill it was okay, kept me warm. If there isn't a strong wind chill this jacket would be suitable. I can confidently say this would be an awesome mild winter -5c & above or a fall jacket. The hood is a good size for a hat and there are 2 large and 2 small inner pockets. The outer hand pockets are lined and quite warm."

				"review": "So this jacker is VERY warm and I love the hood. That being said the Duck outer is too soft and not as durable compared to my carhartt jackets and the snaps are far too weak, but I could live with those two problems, the one that really bothers me is the placement of the side pockets. they are on the side seams of the jacket meaning I have to reach backward to get my hand into them. Also there are no inside pockets. But overall I'm not returning this jacket because it's very warm and has a hood.\n\nPositives:\nVery warm\nhas a thin hood which can be tucker inside\nZipper and snap combination holds in heat\nNot carhartt, since carhartt forced their workers to take a poison vaccine.\n\nNegatives:\nouter shell too soft\nweak snaps\nPocket placement\nLack of inner pockets\nSmall sizing"

				"review": "I have owned a standard carhartt hooded coat for 12 years. It had the arctic lining and was great if you weren’t working. Thing was too hot for splitting wood or shoveling snow. This coat has a Sherpa lining which has held up well over the past year I’ve owned it. But the best feature is the fact that the cuffs stay around my wrist when I drive. I’m 6’1 and the previous carhartt I owned the cuffs would ride up to my lower forearms when I drove my truck which I hated. These stay put and have extra outer material that lays over the cuffs for extra protection and warmth. Wind doesn’t pass through this coat and is very warm but not too warm where you can’t work. The tail flap in the back hangs lower which is nice too when bending over so you’re not giving anyone a show. If you’re a bigger guy on the fence about this jacket get it you won’t be disappointed."

Got the XLT. Boy does it fit good! I'm definitely still keeping it! Looks good and with a few layers I'm not worried about getting cold.

Maybe that's the difference of relaxed fit? Carhartt is the only brand of jacket ive found that i can wear medium because i have long arms in proportion to my height.

This comes down to just below the belly button, and lets the lower part of my shirts or under layers show.

That is, as most shirts and jackets go up in size, they usually increase in trunk size, but not much in arm length. So, it becomes difficult to find jackets that fit my shoulders and arms, but don't leave my torso swimming.\n\nThis jacket is no exception. It fits a little on the boxy side in the trunk since it does not have any taper to it, and the arms are about an inch or more shorter than I'd like them to be. I ordered this jacket in XL, but I have jackets that fit me perfectly in sizes ranging from L to XXXL depending on brand, so it's always a guessing game.\n\nThat being said, this jacket seems to be well-constructed and decently warm. I just wish it fit better because it looks very good!"

Also think it'll be the perfect warmth, although I have not yet worn it out as it hasn't been cold enough."

				"review": "Great looking Dickies ike jacket and well constructed sturdy jacket to last years. I'm 5'9\" 200 lbs 44\" Chest with love handles😋and I mostly wear XL shirts and jackets. I've had a black Ike jacket in XL for a few years now and it always felt too bulky. So I finally got around to trying a Large in the Moss color and it fits way better, and looks fantastic! Still a little bulky, but more tailored looking as you can see in my pics where I compare the Black XL version and the Moss Large version. Also showing the zipper closed where I still have room for my belly and shoulders in the Large. So I recommend sizing down unless you want a relaxed fit or plan to add really thick layers under the jacket. I was also worried the moss color would be too light but it's not as you can see in my pictures. I also show the inside pocket with my regular sized wallet inside and has room for more. Dickies make great quality garments and overall I'm very happy with my purchase😁!"

				"reviewTitle": " Stupidly large sleeve cuffs",
				"review": "It’s odd, the unlined eisenhower jacket is made of the same material as the 874 pants, but the lined jacket is not, looks shiny, needs to be heavily broken in. Zip seems fine for now. My only beef is the sleeve cuffs are HUGE, I’m going to take the button off and move it out a bit to make the sleeves fit better and tighter. There’s no doubt the quality of Dickies have plummeted in recent years, if you’re looking for a jacket to last, go find an older Carhartt. (New Carhartt is just has bad as new Dickies) That’s consumerism for you, if you make a jacket to last 10+ years, they won’t be making any money for a while, if they make a trash jacket that lasts 1-3 years, well there you go. I’m not using this for work, as I know it won’t last 2 days in the yard."

I'm 6'2 and 100kg. Arms are a little baggy but allow for room for a under layer. Is overall a nice jacket and I receive plenty of compliments with it :) worth a try just order a size down!"

				"review": "I love this jacket, but the sizing is seriously out. I ordered the navy blue in a large (my usual sizing) and the jacket that came was freaking huge! After a prompt return and exchange I now have the medium and the jacket is now spot on.\n\nA few things to note: the bottom of the jacket does sit quite high on the hips. The zip is not great as it keeps sticking but you can rub a wax candle along the zips teeth and this helps hugely in making the zip move more freely. I would suggest the coat is more an autumn and spring coat one, though it is lined I can see the jacket not coping with extremely cold weather. But all of that aside though I love it."

				"review": "So I read that it was suggested that you size up, but I’m going to say it blatantly, size up! My wife bought me this exact coat last year for Christmas but I’ve lost a lot of weight so it was too big. I decided to get another because you couldn’t beat the sale  had on them. I got a large because that’s the size I usually wear in shirts and hoodies. I should’ve got an X-Large, I work in a warehouse that’s freezing in the winter and boiling in the summer. I put on a long John shirt and a sweater and my shoulders are so tight I can’t move them lol!! So definitely size up!! Other than that this coat is the warmest I’ve owned other than Carhartt."

				"review": "I was a bit worried that at the price I paid ($58), i would receive a knockoff. I'm happy to report the jacket appears to be genuine. The MSRP on the tag attached was $98, so I feel it was a good deal. The jacket is stylish and well made. I have noticed no flaws and it held up perfectly in the wash (cold water and low heat in dryer/line dried) on the day it came in. At 6'4\" and 205 lbs I would have preferred a large tall but it wasn't available so I ordered XL. The fit is pretty good; a bit roomier than I need but with a sleeve length that is almost perfect. The jacket is warm enough for my climate (SE Texas) but would probably not be sufficient for sub freezing days. As others have said the sleeves aren't lined with the faux wool HOWEVER they are lined with quilted nylon so the whole jacket is lined. I'm very happy with the purchase."
