As noted in many reviews the sleeves are a little long but they roll up perfectly and stay rolled. If I had ordered my normal small perhaps the sleeves would have been a perfect length.

In fact, I like this one even better since the fleece is softer and it doesn't have any logos on the exterior.\n\nAt just under 5'4\", 125, and a 32D chest, I'm usually a small in tops and jackets. I ordered this in an XS since that was the only size available. It fits well, but is snug across the bustline when zipped, so a small would definitely be better.\n\nThe quality of the zippers is also nice. There is a pull on the main front zipper, and the side pockets also have heavy-duty zippers. The only thing that lets you know that it's an -branded product is the interior tag.\n\nThis is the first piece of clothing I've tried from Amazon Essentials, and I'm very impressed with it!"},{"name":"Earth For Humanity~","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Very cozy~","review":"I'm a nurse and needed something cozy and professional for the winter months at work and this exceeded my expectations.

Not exactly the same shade blue as the picture, it is slightly darker, but also nice.\n---\nThis is my 1st  essentials clothing order. And I have to say that I love this item. I'm between a medium and a large, depending on brands and how I want things to fit. I ordered a large and it was too big. I think if I wanted to wear this as an outdoor coat, then it would be ok with a lot of layered clothes underneath. But I intended to wear this indoors. So I reordered this in medium and it fits fantastically.\nThe material is soft and smooth/compact, not full of fuzz or lint like some other fleece jackets I see from other popular brands. The stitching is also good in quality. Even the inside seems are sewn down (have you ever had jackets where the flaps along the zipper are sticking up inside? messy!). Pockets are deep and can fit my whole hand (believe me, I didn't know this could be a problem until my last raincoat could barely fit my phone in there). There are also pockets inside the jacket!\nOverall, I would purchase again if I wanted more colors!"},{"name":"Brianne","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"2/5","reviewTitle":" Not holding up well","review":"I bought this for work, I am an RN. I was thrilled with this jacket at first. It fit as expected, doesn‚Äôt seem to fade or pill and it was warm for my night shift. Unfortunately it isn‚Äôt holding up to frequent washings, 1-2x a week.

The zippers are not at all flimsy. The zipped pockets are useful for keeping my phone or keys. The thickness is probably warm enough for temperature around 40's to 50's. The sizing is accurate. I normally wear either a Small or an Extra Small (5'2 and 115lb) so I ordered both sizes. The sleeves are a bit long on the Small and I could layer the jacket on top of a shirt. The Extra Small fits like a glove and feels just right if you don't want to layer. Overall, a great purchase.

My dog chewed on a zipper a day prior to it, but I still decided to carry the jacket for extra warmth in the evening when walking around the camp site. However, the dobbie got cold during the trip so I decided to just give it to her. I give this item 5 starts on her behalf as she was very warm and comfy.\n\nP.S. The material is really soft and warm, I wore it a bit during the first day of backpacking and it felt great.

Good for the Price","review":"After reading a number of reviews and answers saying that the sizing runs small on this fleece, I ordered a size up. I tried it on as soon as it arrived and... it was huge!! Please find attached an artists impression of the incident, as I didn't take a photo.\n\nI'm assuming these were small in the past but the sizing has since been corrected. I'm a UK size 12-14 and, after exchanging the huge one, ordered a Medium. The fit was perfect!\n\nRegarding quality, you get what you pay for. I love the pattern, the fleece is soft and the zips work fine. It's only a thin fleece, so good for milder weather or layering. Pockets are a good size too.\nAfter wearing this regularly for 2 weeks, some threads around the trims and seams came loose (nothing is actually coming apart) and I've had to snip them off. This is why I've given 4 stars instead of 5.\n\nOverall, it's a good lightweight fleece with a nice choice of patterns & colours. Decent quality for the price.

It has a great tailored fit, without being tight, and the length is awesome.

I'm SOOO glad I did, while hiking in Vermont we rain into a rainstorm on our way down the mountain. And when I say rain, it POURED BUCKETS AND HAILED and HIGH WINDS. This jacket kept my entire upper body completely dry minus my hands and part of my chest where I had it exposed to the elements (my doing). But underneath I was dry and stayed warm the ENTIRE way down, I've owned rain jackets in the past that haven't even come close to how waterproof this jacket was. It's very light weight and easy to carry in a pack if you're traveling. I ordered a small and had room to layer underneath. I love how the back end is longer to cover my butt when hiking with a backpack on. It never rode up or anything which is always a plus. If you're looking for something lightweight, want to layer underneath (or not) this jacket is well worth the money. I've been bringing it with me hiking ever since. I literally don't go anywhere without it now, I'm so glad I purchased this before my trip or else I would of been soaked like my hiking mate was with her non waterproof jacket üòû. Would highly recommend! Thinking about ordering another color. If you're going for warmth though this jacket wouldn't be it, it's quite thin like a windbreaker but honestly I'd rather layer with my own clothes than have a thick jacket. 10/10 would recommend."},{"name":"Judy B.","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" No surprise, exactly as advertised","review":"Well made jacket, ordered a 2X and it fits exactly as I expected it should.

To me, the \"nocturnal blue\" looks black. That's fine with me, as I would have ordered black if it was available.

I bought this coat in the pink/ salmon colour in size Medium for hiking/ camping/ everyday wear and it‚Äôs so stylish! Also, the darting in the back of the jacket (around the waist and rear) makes it such a flattering fit on the female body. I usually am a size Small in Columbia products. I read the sizing chart and was so glad that I sized up to a size Medium (I‚Äôm a size 6-8 in dress sizes and I‚Äôm 140 lbs. and 5‚Äù4) and the M fits perfectly. The length (with it hitting just below my rear) is really desirable for a rain coat. And the lining is a thin fabric (in my opinion this is better than a simple mesh lining) and it‚Äôs soft and just a little bit warm to cut the chill of a rainy day. Highly recommend this product. I bought this jacket on sale for $63 on  and it‚Äôs full price at $90.00 (written on the tag) is an indicator of the quality of this jacket. I‚Äôm in love with it!

Don‚Äôt hesitate this jacket is perfect!"},{"name":"Sally O'Malley","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Very impressed!","review":"Beautiful jacket. Very well-made. I don't wear leather, so I was thrilled to find a quality, vegan leather jacket. I ended up returning it though because of the slim fit. I'm top heavy (36DD) and the medium was snug around my chest, but fit everywhere else. I didn't go up to a large because I was afraid it might look too bulky around my shoulders. I may try one of the other faux leather Levi's moto style jackets because the quality is amazing."},{"name":"JustACustomer","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" I'm in love. Surprised at quality and fit.","review":"First off the jacket does look like fake leather almost like couch leather but that doesn't really bother me that much. The detail on the jacket is awesome there's little bits of design everywhere which I love. The zippers on the sleeves are just for show when you unzip them they reveal a fake pocket. The hand pockets fit my hands and take a lot of work to fit my phone in. the chest pocket can't fit my phone I'm pretty sure but maybe an ID or something. The buttons for the collar do make a weird tapping sound if you don't make sure to button them. There were also a few loose threads on the back that I cut off. I was wary about buying a leather jacket on  but I'm glad I did. I got a small and I'm 5'3 almost 5'4 and 125 pounds with a big bust and it fits perfectly. The sleeves are snug but that's how I wanted it to fit. At first when I looked at it I thought it might be too big and would make me look bulky but when I put it on it was fitted and looked very feminine. It's also pretty warm but if you get snow you might want to wear a similar colored hoodie underneath."},{"name":"Nancyjua","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Get It!","review":"This is the jacket I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

It is a bit short for what I usually wear, but that's the cool style I hear and so I got it. Man am I glad I did. It's so comfy and so cool, but without being TOO cool. I think if you're someone who likes classic styles but wants something feminine with a bit of edge you'll love this.\n\nIt's also super comfy and almost seems like it has some stretch, which makes no sense. It's very supple and fits beautifully.

I ordered a large because I like my rain coats to feel oversized. Over all TNF models, I chose the Venture, because it‚Äôs lightweight and still protects you from the wind, cold, and rain. The huge collar and mesh linings on the Resolve jackets (Resolve Plus, Parka, and regular Resolve) ends up making me feel hot and weighed down. The length of the Venture is 25-26 inches- where the Resolve is 24 inches, the Resolve Plus is 26 and the Resolve Parka is 27 inches. Confusing, I know! Overall, the Venture is lightest with the most protection. If you want a more form- fitting look, I would go for a medium (with my height and weight). There are so many great colors, but I couldn‚Äôt decide, so I got black. I ended up getting my tween girl an XL in Sodalite blue, and it‚Äôs gorgeous. We walked in a downpour the other day and stayed completely dry. You can‚Äôt go wrong so buy it! You won‚Äôt regret it!"},{"name":"FIniestra","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" FITS EXACTLY AS I HOPED IT WOULD !","review":"So i purchased this jacket based on my significant other‚Äôs recommendation since we‚Äôre hiking up Mt. Herard out in Colorado in a few weeks. Needless to say, i‚Äôm so happy i bought this ! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and weigh 110lbs, chest size 32c. i purchased an XS. I was so afraid this jacket was going to be extremely fitted but once it arrived i could immediately tell it wasn‚Äôt going to be that way at all. i‚Äôm petite so it‚Äôs a tad roomy but i‚Äôm fine with that bc now i definitely have the option to layer it when the cooler weather hits but the jacket by itself is still so comfortable and fits so nicely and is so lightweight. The only ‚Äúdislike‚Äù would be the arm length but i have pretty short arms so this tends to be the case with a lot of jackets.... Fortunately the velcro at the wrists of the sleeves fixes that length issue entirely!(: i also took that custom sizing test to see what i would be and it told me i should get a Small... which would‚Äôve been massive on me. Glad i listened to my gut and went with the XS! But overall i highly recommend this product if you want something that‚Äôs functional/practical for almost anywhere except the extreme cold."},{"name":"Dee","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" North Face, Can't Go Wrong","review":"You simply cannot go wrong with North Face. We have purchased NF for our daughter every year for Back to School shopping. Living in the Seattle area you need a good rain jacket. We like the weight of the jacket and the air venting is cool under the arm pits. The vents can be unzipped. Everything arrived as expected and within the timeframe expected.

Ordered and wore this for a trip that was calling for rain. Kept me very dry. It was very lightweight and comfortable. Some reviews said the jacket was very noisy, this didn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôm just shy of 5‚Äô10‚Äù and plus-size so, I was worried about purchasing online. Not only did this fit me perfectly, I loved the length and the large inside pockets. Usually hoods tend to leave my hairline exposed. This one did not, it was great. My only complaint is that there is no lining in the sleeves. When it‚Äôs warm and wet out, the sleeves tend to be a bit sticky. Otherwise, I love it.\n**2020 UPDATE**\nStill LOVE this jacket. Perfect on rainy and windy days. Still haven‚Äôt found a solution to the sticky sleeves when it‚Äôs really hot and humid out (NC weather üôÑ) but it‚Äôs perfect in the spring and fall when I layer."},{"name":"Amanda Noordyk","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Perfect Rain Jacket","review":"I've always loved North Face products but really only had heavy winter jackets. This rain coat is super lightweight. No warmth at all but it's the perfect wind breaker and completely water proof. It could be packed super small if you were traveling. I just plan to wear it while walking my dogs. I am 5'2\" and 135lbs. I could have ordered a small but I went with a medium so I could wear a sweatshirt under it when needed. I like the zipper pockets and the fact that it has a hood. The ONLY thing I somewhat dislike is the inside material sticks to your skin if you sweat while wearing it. Still would recommend this jacket, just something to be aware of."},{"name":"Lou","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" LOVE this jacket for spring, or fall.....I would definitely size up for a roomy fit!","review":"I LOVE this jacket, and the great thing was I got it for half off... I love North Face but sometimes it can become too expensive! I love that this jacket is light weight. To me, its perfect for Spring or Fall when its a little chilly outside where you still need a jacket & can wear a sweatshirt under it!\nI sized up, from reading reviews - I normally wear a Large, so I got a XL. I may have been okay in a Large, but I do like my jackets a little bigger so I can wear layers underneath! I am 5'3, 160 LBs, and the XL works for me!
