I typically opt for the racerback tank top style for my workout shirts but I'm also very fair-skinned and I wanted a bit more protection from the sun for my shoulders and back when I'm outside during peak sunshine hours. I own a number of Under Armour products so I was well aware of the quality when I decided to purchase this shirt. Like a lot of people, I was hesitant on the sizing since Under Armour's clothes fit differently depending on the style. Under Armour classifies this shirt as a loose fit as opposed to semi-fitted, fitted, or compression fit.\n\nFor reference, I am 5'6\", 150 pounds, with a 36D chest and a medium fits me perfectly! I wear a medium or large depending on the style and fit of the shirt but, thanks to the help of other reviewers, I was able to successfully order my correct size for this shirt. This shirt is part of UA's Heatgear line which is meant to keep you cool when it's warm out. I've already worn this shirt several times and it is incredibly comfortable. It is made in Jordan of 100% polyester and is very soft and lightweight. It is so comfortable that I don't have any problems with range of motion or anything while exercising. This shirt is a V-neck style which is nice since it adds a little bit of a design over the scoop neck style shirts and it still has good chest coverage so I don't feel like I'm indecent while bending over. It has an UA logo on the left side of the chest as well as one on the back of the shirt, just below the neck. The length is also really nice and comfortably rests on my upper thighs. I've worn this shirt while walking and playing basketball and have still managed to stay fairly cool. Even though this shirt is lightweight, I don't feel that it's sheer and would show anything that's not meant to be seen. The shirt also washes up nicely. I typically hang dry these shirts so they don't get caught on anything in the dryer and so far, they've been great!\n\nI'm so happy I found this shirt because it's become my go-to t-shirt for working out when I don't want to wear my racerbacks. I originally ordered the Montana Teal/Metallic Silver color and loved it so much that I also ordered Flint/Metallic Silver and Coho/Metallic Silver. I've included a picture of my three shirts so you can see what they look like. At first I thought the Flint/Metallic Silver was a gray color but when I got it, it's actually more of a dusky lilac and, since I love purple, I am even happier! I think the hardest thing for most people is to figure out what size to order for this shirt. My thoughts are, if you have two sizes of shirts that you normally order depending on the brand and style, order the smaller size for this shirt. That's what I did and these shirts ended up fitting me perfectly. They are even nice enough to wear out in public so they are definitely versatile. I highly recommend these shirts because they are great for exercising, there are a lot of colors to choose from, and the price is perfect so you can order more than one!"},{"name":"Julie A.","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" One of my favorite workout tops!","review":"I really love this top - it's one of my favorite workout tops! It's lightweight and wicks moisture really well. It's flattering, with the v-neck and the flattering, feminine cut, and it's VERY comfortable to wear. I'm a 40C, usually wear a L/12 or XL/14 top and I purchased this in the XL. It's loose enough around my curves that it's comfortable and doesn't make me self-conscious. The only thing I'd change is for it to be just an inch or two longer. I'm 5' 5\" and this hits right at the top of my thigh/mid-butt, but because I've got a curvy backside it does tend to ride up a little when I'm working out (especially when walking/running).

I own several different styles and sizes and often wear these to the gym or for a walk around my neighborhood. They are stylish yet modest. I wear mediums and larges in most UA shirts but ordered two of these (black and gray) in XL because the description states they are fitted and sometimes \"fitted\" on me is a bit tight.

For some with smaller busts, the medium might be too large. It's very slimming and the fabric, though you can tell it's a sweat wicking type, it's not too synthetic feeling.

I was not actually expecting to like this shirt so much, but now I can't wait to get other colors. It came out of the package without a wrinkle so it will be perfect for my purposes. In planning for an upcoming trip, I needed to find some shirts for tours in a hot climate. I intend to wash in the bathroom sink and drip dry to keep my luggage as light as possible. This shirt weighs next to nothing, will dry very quickly, and still looks great. While on this trip, we will be doing some cycling so this shirt is a win-win, and is needed for additional cycling after our return home later. My husband has had to similar UA shirt for a couple of years... now I see why he loves it!\n\nIn certain styles of women's shirts, I have to buy an XL due to broad shoulders. In this shirt, the Lg fits me perfectly. It is NOT a compression shirt, but it is not boxy. It shows a lady's shape well, but doesn't cling at all so it nicely hides those extra unsightly bulges at the waistline. What's better than that?\n\nIf you find any information in this review to be helpful, please click \"yes\".

Comfortable, good fit, easy to wash and kept their shape. After about 6 months each t-shirt started to develop an odd smell; damp and plastic smell. Washed them several times but when they came out of the wash and dried they each had this smell that got worse with each wash. All 3 can no longer be worn as the smell is awful. So initially loved these but wearing them maximum once a week (not for sport just around the house), washing in different loads as all different colours they all went off so to speak so will not be buying any more."}]}]
