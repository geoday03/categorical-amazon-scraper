The feminine cut is SO flattering and the snap closure stays shut and doesn't bunch over my chest. I was very worried about it being too snug around my girls but it fit perfectly and falls at a really good, flattering length. I have a regular length torso and it hits a comfortable number of inches below my hip bones. I am 5'4\" and a 34DDD and the L fit perfectly. Even my boss commented that the shirt looked very nice and professional."},{"name":"ZooMa68","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Cool and comfortable and great tailored fit for curvy women.","review":"Super comfy, perfect fit. I am 5'9\" and 195# and got a large. Love the side zip pockets! Not sure what the velcro things are for on the lapels, though. Tailored fit for curves and lightweight enough for my trip to Africa next month. I can wash in sink and it looks like it will dry quickly. I wish my size had been available in darker colors."},{"name":"Waterprisms","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Casual Cool","review":"Even with a dark color this shirt was cool in hot weather.

Don't be fooled, they aren't as comfortable as cotton but I still use them as my go to shirt while traveling to adventure destinations. I am busty so had to go for the bigger size making the rest of the shirt baggy so I may try to take them in on the sides on my own or price it with a tailor, same with the hem that I wish were the same length all the way around."},{"name":"Cruiser 1","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Great travel shirt","review":"This shirt is of excellent and consistent quality.

Fabric - fabulous. Light weight, soft and comfy. Fit - FINALLY a slightly fitted shirt that isn't boxy or way too fitted and tight. It is tapered at the waist just enough to have a contoured fit, plenty of space across the shoulders, length is exactly the right front and back with a curved hem, there is a small split in the sleeve hem which is functional and decorative. Pockets are hidden with zipper closures, but add NO bulk to the shirt.....can be used if you want to, but invisible if you don't. SNAPS NOT BUTTONS......this is such a nice touch. Easy to get on and off with no button to pop off. Love everything about this blouse so much I bought it in 5 colors. As soon as Covid is a mere memory, I am ready to pack and head for the airport....."},{"name":"yessica perez","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Amazing quality, true to size!","review":"Love this shirt it us true to size, I bougth one size larger and it dita a little bit loose but it‚Äôs ok!"},{"name":" Customer","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Quality","review":"Quality item.

They are cool for the summer, and I'm able to get away with them for our office dress code. I order xl in Columbia where medium/large usually works with orher brands. Mainly because as a DD I find the Columbia brand tight in the chest. (Yet it if order the shirt in a mens, small will work kind of odd.) I like the snap closure buttons, but do wish they'd add an additional button or even Velcro closure between the button at the chest on their women's shirts, they do have that gap lots of button down shirts do with larger chested women. I'm also not a fan of that PFG logo on the back and had to add an additional shoulder guard to my work delivery bag because the strap catches in the stupid logo. But overall do recommend."},{"name":"Olive","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"4/5","reviewTitle":" Tr√®s l√©ger","review":"Chemisier tr√®s l√©ger; s√®che rapidement.

They have a somewhat androgynous fit, with a more or less straight cut from armpit to hip. I have a few slim fit men‚Äôs shirts because that‚Äôs my look, but these are far better, since they are made to fit a figure with hips (which means it fits all the way down without buttons straining to the bottom of the shirt). Bonus: great price.\n\nSo if you are looking for a straight fit (as opposed to tailored or princess seamed, which is made to create an hourglass), this is a great shirt with lots of fabric options.

I would consider it summer-weight.\nWrinkles sort of easily while worn, so this might be more suited for casual wear. Comes out of the dryer not needing to be ironed, if you remove it promptly. I launder on warm and dry on lukewarm and have noticed no shrinkage.\nStitching is top-notch - no flubbed seams or errant threads.\n\nI am 5'7\" and 175, very full B cup, waist is 37\" and hips are 45\" - I typically wear a L-XL top, in major US brands. I ordered this in the XL and the fit is pretty good. I have \"beefy\" arms, and this shirt is NOT too tight in the arm for me - I have plenty of arm room.\n\nManufactured in Bangladesh.\n\nGratefully received through the üåøVine Programüåø for my *honest and unbiased* review.\nIf my opinion changes, I will be sure to update this review."},{"name":"TTR79","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Good buy!","review":"Really nice reasonably thick good quality and pretty!

I saw another review call it a \"boyfriend cut\". I'm 5'8 and about 120, and it's baggier than a lot of the standard cut men's Goodthread shirts. I know I didn't order the wrong size though because it fits just fine in the shoulders. I like the aqua striped pattern, it's a cute shirt overall but the fit/cut just isn't great for my body, so I'm probably gonna return it, since the slim fit men's Goodthreads in XS are so much better on me. It's probably a better shirt if you're plus sized or wider than you are tall, and I like the pocket and pattern. I wish there was just a little more of a women's shape or brought in on the waist.\n\nIt does wrinkle easily but I don't really mind, it's kinda cute. You could easily starch this to prevent that if you wanted."},{"name":"Lauren Fuquay","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" @xosimplylo for more  fashion","review":"I love this top!\nIt's hard to find a button down that isn't thin and cheaply made, at an affordable price.\n\nThis one hits the mark.

Wore today for the first time. It is so soft and comfy. I'm a pear shape figured woman so I always buy large shirts. I'm 5'9\", 150#. Fit is good, not too bulky to tuck into my pants. Length was as described. I'm going to order more of these in other colors. I haven't washed it yet. If it's too wrinkly and I have to iron it...well...that won't do. üòú But I'll get back on here and update if I need to. Otherwise I give the black/white gingham shirt 5 stars!\nUpdate: 2020, I just ordered the black in medium and am so happy! These wash up beautifully. I recommend popping them in the dryer alone for 2 minutes to begin drying then hang to release the wrinkles. They dry QUICKLY! LOVE THIS SHIRT.

It was clear to see that it had previously been folded round card to make it presentable. I can only assume someone has returned this blouse at some point and it has been sent out to me in the state it was returned, a crumpled mess. Very poor customer service. The sleeves were a good length and roomy for a comfortable fit. However the front buttons barely fastened.
