The guy who did them didnt know what he was doing, he gave her butterfly back earrings and didnt give her a bar long enough to cope with the swelling. We switched to different earrings and found out she was allergic to the \"fake metal\" in those earrings and the peircings started to reject. I found these and immediately knew that this is what she needed. The variety in the size if the diamonds also gave her the choice to pick what she actually wanted instead of the generic \"this is what we have so this is what you get\" most places offer. The flat backs were wide enough to keep her ears from basically absorbing them like they did the original piercing. And the bar was long enough that it helped with the swelling caused by the previous earring rejecting. In two weeks her ears were finally able to heal. The flat backs were also comfortable on her to sleep on while her ears were healing.

It is attached to a holder that is much smaller than the box which allows the necklace to bounce around in the box. I found a piece of packing from a necklace box of mine and used it in the box to hold the necklace in place. At this price point I think a nice presentation in the box isn‚Äôt too much to expect."},{"name":"Dawn","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Granddaughter loves","review":"This was a gift for my tween granddaughter who lives in another state so my review is based on pictures of her wearing it. It appears a bit delicate so probably best not worn if playing sports or doing other vigorous activities. Looks lovely on her and she loves it."},{"name":"Jake","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Great quality!","review":"We ordered the rose gold druzzy necklace.
