If you are on the chunkier side, then it won't lay correctly and you may end up trying to adjust it all day long which can be annoying. But overall a great product, quality and very beautiful.

				"review": "Bought this for my girlfriend, her words...\nI have been suffering with infected ears for years. I stopped wearing any and as a result my earring holes had to be pushed through every time I wanted to wear some. I needed a solution to keep the earring holes open but without infection and this product really delivered. I have been wearing them for weeks now and no infection. Popping them in for the first time was a bit fiddly but it is true that you are better off doing it without the mirror. I tighten them once in a while but they stay put even so I shower everyday, had several pool days and work out 5-6 days a week."

				"review": "I had actually ordered from this company before and got the gold initial bracelet (which is also very amazing). The quality of this necklace is unbelievable. It feels so expensive and looks amazing. I have worn the necklaces of course together as well as separate and I absolutely love it! It comes so nicely packaged. Hands down 10/10 recommend! It is so so so nice! Does not look cheap at all, does not feel cheap, nothing about it says cheap. So if you are giving it as a gift, it comes in a cute little black box and then each necklace is in its own back and then those bags are places in another bag. A small shinning cloth is in the box as well. It's incredibly nice. Love this company!"

I will note that I have added my own extender to the shorter, paper clip style, necklace to make it fit better. I feel like these are surprisingly good quality given how affordable they are. I have had no quality issues, however, I do not sleep or shower in these necklaces. I would highly recommend this set as a great addition to anyone‚Äôs jewelry collection. I have gotten a lot of compliments."

A diamond's most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler's magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond's clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond's clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.\n\nDiamond Color:\n\nThough diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side.\n\nDiamond Carat Weight:\n\nA diamond's weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.\n\nDiamond Certification:\n\nA diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site. Such certificates are issued by several agencies employing highly trained gemologists and provide an unbiased and accurate evaluation of the diamond. These gemologists scrutinize each stone to analyze its dimensions, clarity, cut, color, finish, symmetry, and other details.\n\nDiamonds purchased from the Amazon.com Collection may be certified by the Gemological Institute of America or the International Gemological Institute. The type of certificate provided will be noted in the product specifications of your jewelry purchase; if you do not see a certificate type noted, one will not be provided.\n\nOur Diamond Policy:\n\nAmazon.com sources high-quality diamonds from some of the world's largest suppliers. All our diamond suppliers certify that to their best knowledge their diamonds are not conflict diamonds.\n\nDiamond Care:\n\nDiamonds, as the hardest substance on earth, are resistant to damage. However, diamond jewelry is set in different metals, and care will vary from piece to piece. Diamonds should be cleaned in a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, using a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any dirt. It is a good idea to have them cleaned once a year by a professional jeweler, at which time the security of the setting can be checked as well. Diamond jewelry should be stored in a soft cloth pouch to ensure that the stone will not scratch other jewelry.",

Out to school. Work. Daily excursions and shopping.\n\nThe colour has not even tarnished a single bit. The gold is still so shiny and PEEERRRRFFFFEEEECTTTTTTTTT (with exclusion of the extension chain which has tarnished just a teensy tiny bit but that‚Äôs to be expected because my neck is sweatier than any other part of my body half or the time)!!!!!!! Plus, the gold isn‚Äôt overly yellow so it‚Äôs a really luxurious colour that doesn‚Äôt look cheap at all :D\n\nTo be 100% honest I‚Äôve mostly only been wearing the pendant necklace but that‚Äôs because I fell in love with it and I don‚Äôt have many formal occasions that require both layers.. and you can SEPARATE THE NECKLACES!!! The biggest W about this necklace ever‚ÄîI hate multilayer necklaces that are inseparable because sometimes I want to wear them individually!!!\n\nIt also comes in this cute little teal box that I like to open and close a lot because the top fits right over the bottom which is a detail that has no relevance to the necklace itself but I thought it was pretty neat.\n\nSo to sum up!!!\n\nSeparatable layers? ‚úÖ\nGorgeous colour? ‚úÖ‚úÖ\nSuper duper long lasting and with the durability of a fortress? ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ\n\nYouuuu neeeeeeeed this necklace it goes well with literally everything and you will never get tired of it 100% promise I‚Äôm going to wear it tomorrow again too"

It does get caught when layered with other bracelets, so better to wear alone if that would bother you. I also find that it twists around a lot and will not stay with the flat side facing out (the one I have has the engraving on the outside). Other than those issues, the quality seems good.\n\nI also sent one to my Mother for her birthday, the one about mothers and daughters and distance etc.) She said she really likes it and didn't mention any issues with hers."

				"review": "I was thrilled getting these cuties! I never owned Betsy Johnson jewelry, and these just grabbed my attention and seeing the backing sold me that they would be quality.\nThey arrived perfect in a new unhandled box.\nInspecting them as I always do as a jewelry designer myself, they are perfect for costume jewelry. I did not see stainless or hypoallergenic notes anywhere. I have allergies to metals except precious metals and stainless.\nI wore them all day yesterday to test them. Yes, I reacted immediately to them but stuck wearing them to see how I handled it. I had crusted puss after removal which means these have nickle, cadmium, zinc or copper in them. I pray there is no cadmium.\nToday, after disinfecting 3 times, my ears are tender. I will still wear them. Only I cannot wear them daily. I might glaze clear nail polish over the hooks or swap them for real gold hooks.\nThey have weight and substance which I love. I already got complimented yesterday on the street for them. They do grab attention in sunlight or halogens.\nThe caged back is everything. It just makes them feel like luxury earrings. The plating is perfect. This is not cheap feeling or Ardene quality, this feels like high end costume jewelry.\nI love her jewelry lines, some are cooky, juvenile, fun and some are creepy cute which I lean towards. If these owls were black and sparkly I would love them too.\nGreat gift that will make whoever gets them always think of you.\n4 stars because she can definitely make all her jewelry stainless or brass based rather than something half the planet is allergic to. I know as a designer it's a touch more expensive but we are talking cents in volumes. Absolutely no reason she can't afford to do stainless or brass. Great designs, poor metal bases.\nBut still recommend they are so cute in person."

The issue I have is that we‚Äôre actually cheaper than they were asking on Amazon and pretty much having my nose rubbed in it."

		"description": "Betsey Johnson illusion necklace featuring mixed faceted beads, delicate stone accents, lovely flowers and heart embellished with woven mixed multi-colored charms. Necklace is set in gold-tone metal with a lobster clasp closure.\n\n\n\n\nNew York designer Betsey Johnson has built her long-standing career in fashion by following her own set of rules. Known for her celebration of the exuberant, the embellished, and the over the top, Betsey has been rocking the fashion industry with her unique and original designs since the 1960‚Äôs. Her commitment to remain true to her one-of-a-kind vision has afforded Betsey continued success in an industry known for its fickleness. Her ability to change with the times while keeping her designs pure has not gone unnoticed. At the 1999 CFDA Awards, Betsey was presented The Timeless Talent Award created especially for her, which recognized her influence on fashion throughout her career.\n\nBetsey was born in Connecticut and spent her childhood in dance classes. Her aspirations to be a dancer and her love for costumes laid the foundation for Betsey‚Äôs creativity and inspiration, which is still evident in her designs today. In 1964, Betsey officially entered the New York fashion scene by winning Mademoiselle magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúGuest Editor Contest.‚Äù One year later, she landed the top designer position for Paraphernalia, a clothing boutique that at the time housed the hottest young London designers, including Mary Quant and Paco Rabanne, among others. What would soon become known as Betsey‚Äôs trademark look began its formulations here: sexy silhouettes, hippie inspired flowing fabrics, whimsical detailing and, most importantly, a fabulous fit.\n\nNow firmly part of what was considered the ‚ÄúYouth Quake,‚Äù Betsey soon found herself in the unforgettable 1960‚Äôs Warhol scene. Edie Sedgwick was her house model, while the Velvet Underground‚Äôs John Cale took to wearing her designs both on-stage and off. In 1969, Betsey began her foray into retail by opening a new boutique called Betsey Bunki Nini. Directly following the opening store Betsey was offered a job from Alvin Duskin in San Francisco and thus began living a bi-coastal life for the remaining years of the 60‚Äôs.\n\nAlong with the new decade came new career opportunities for Betsey and in the early 1970‚Äôs, she came into creative control of the label Alley Cat, a label which set the trends for the 70‚Äôs rock n‚Äô roll clothing, with bohemian and ethnic styles. In 1972, along with Halston, Betsey won the coveted Coty Award becoming the youngest designer to ever receive the honor.\n\nAfter a decade of designing for other labels, Betsey decided to make a dramatic change in her life and in 1978, she formed a partnership with Chantal Bacon and started the Betsey Johnson label, as it is known today. Designing for herself allowed Betsey the creative freedom to execute her vision to its fullest potential. The same year Betsey and Chantal launched their first retail store in the heart of Soho. In the early 80‚Äôs, they were one of the first to open a store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, helping the street to gain its worldwide recognition as one of the best shopping areas of the 1980‚Äôs. Today there are over sixty-five Betsey Johnson stores worldwide. International expansion came in 1998 with the opening of the wildly popular London store. In 1999 the Vancouver store opened marking the company‚Äôs first move into Canada, where there are now four locations in various provinces. In September 2006, the first Betsey Johnson store opened in Japan. Betsey Johnson clothing is also available in better department stores as well as in specialty stores throughout the United States and numerous countries around the world.\n\nThe year 2003 marked some exciting licensing endeavors for the company, taking Betsey‚Äôs signature prints and whimsy to new audiences with categories including handbags and lingerie. She continued this trend and has since added footwear, belts, eyewear, watches, jewelry, swimwear, legwear, outerwear and a fragrance thus effectively emerging as not only a clothing designer but a top American Lifestyle brand.\n\nIn late 2002, Betsey was honored with an induction into the Fashion Walk of Fame, honoring her contribution to American fashion. A bronze and granite plaque containing an original sketch, signature and biography was embedded into Seventh Avenue sidewalk in early 2003. In March 2005, the Signature Awards and NAWBO-NYC committee honored Betsey with the 2005 Lifetime Achievement Award. And following that, Betsey received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Accessories Council in November 2005. Betsey Johnson was also honored with the Designer of the Year Award at the annual Fashion Accessories Benefit Ball (FABB) in May 2007 and was recently honored with the National Arts Club Medal of Honor for Lifetime Achievement in Fashion in October 2009.\n\nA survivor of breast cancer, Betsey continues to be a strong advocate in the fight against the disease, making public appearances, participating in numerous fund raising events and creating one-of-a-kind items that have been auctioned off to raise funds for many charities. In 2003, the CFDA asked her to be an Honorary Chairperson for the Fashion Targets Breast Cancer initiative, which she graciously accepted. In April of 2004, she was awarded another honor by the National Breast Cancer Coalition (NBCC) for her continuous fight against Breast Cancer at a prestigious ceremony hosted by Ron Perelman. In Spring of 04, she teamed up with Geralyn Lucas, the author of the book ‚ÄúWhy I Wore Lipstick...to my Mastectomy,‚Äù designing an accompanying t-shirt which was launched in Betsey Johnson stores nationwide in October 2004 at a series of events called ‚ÄúCourage Nights.‚Äù Courage Night continued for its second year in October 2005 where CFDA Fashion Targets Breast Cancer and SELF Magazine joined the cause. Johnson continues to support, hosting a charity event each October in her boutiques nationwide and internationally, as well as creating limited edition products from which a portion of the proceeds are donated to various breast cancer related charities.\n\nBetsey Johnson, both the woman and the label, is constantly moving forward and continues to keep a strong foothold in the fashion industry with no signs of letting up anytime soon. Her love of detail and design is evident in everything she does in life and in business. Her enthusiasm, creativity and boundless talent that have kept her at the forefront of fashion for the past 45 years will keep Betsey going for years to come.\n\n‚ÄúMaking clothes involves what I like‚Ä¶color, pattern, shape and movement‚Ä¶I like the everyday process‚Ä¶the people, the pressure, the surprise of seeing the work come alive walking and dancing around on strangers. Like red lipstick on the mouth, my products wake up and brighten and bring the wearer to life‚Ä¶drawing attention to her beauty and specialness‚Ä¶her moods and movements‚Ä¶her dreams and fantasies.‚Äù ‚Äì Betsey Johnson\n\nAs one journalist recently quoted, ‚ÄúIf Betsey Johnson didn‚Äôt exist, we would have to invent her, simply to remind ourselves that fashion can be fun. She‚Äôs the original wild child and set to paint the town pink!‚Äù",

This is one of those things that I have had on my wish list for a while, but couldn‚Äôt justify spending the money - other bills and things were more important. But the other night, with a little Christmas melancholy and hope, I said ‚ÄúI deserve something whimsical and fanciful this holiday season. I work too hard not to order something every now and then that I want, but don‚Äôt necessarily need. Besides, if not now (during these crazy times), then when?‚Äù So what could it harm if I click, ‚Äútry for 7 days before you buy it.‚Äù This was really because I thought that MAYBE I would‚Äôt really keep it. Guess what, I LOVE IT. It is so unique and fun, that I didn‚Äôt even wait on the 7 days to expire before clicking keep/buy. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\nThis Betsey Johnson necklace is beautiful. It is a mixture of layers, beads, and fun!! It is colorful - accented by hearts, flowers and beads. It is whimsical and fun. It will match any and everything. This was the perfect purchase with the exception of the packaging. Maybe it was because this was a ‚Äútry before you buy‚Äù item, but this necklace literally arrived in a ziplock baggie. No thrills or frills at all, which was disappointing since this necklace is so pretty. Personally, I think the packaging should match the look of the necklace - nice. With the exception of the packaging, this necklace is 5 stars."
