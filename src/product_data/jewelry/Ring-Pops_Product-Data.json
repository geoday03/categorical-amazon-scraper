The one on my phone is a vinyl material and has an alligator design, so it's raised in parts. This ring adhered to it without a problem, and has held up to daily use since April. If the ring is tight, that's because the adhesive they use for the back goes over the ring part, so the ring gets stuck to the glue and makes it hard to turn. But I found 2 things work to fix that: First, when you adhere the ring, don't push the center where the ring is, just push all around it. This way the ring part itself doesn't get adhered by the glue. 2nd, if you do push it where the ring is, just keep turning the ring to try to break the seal of the glue. Just keep doing that a number of times until it loosens up enough for you. I would think if you do it too much it will get too loose, don't know, never got that far. But I've used both methods on these type of ring holders and both work, I've just never turned the ring until it was too loose. I'd recommend these."}]},{"id":"kmnaX-","title":"Bazooka Candy Brands Holiday Candy Box - 18 Count Lollipops W/ Assorted Flavors From Ring Pop, Push Pop, Baby Bottle Pop & Juicy Drop - Candy Gift Box For The Holidays - 12.4 Ounce (Pack Of 1)","imageUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/91mGRW3yDoL._SX425_.jpg","price":"$16.99","description":"Bazooka Candy Brands‚Äô lollipop candy mix is the ultimate bulk variety of hard candy this holiday season!

It works without having to use any of the included stickers, rings and cleaning pads that are included for using with other phones or iPads, Kindles, etc.\n\nThe ring gives me a good grip on my iPhone and allows me to hold on more securely and with less fatigue. I'll be less likely to drop the phone while using this ring grip.\n\nThe ring is easy to remove when not in use, or for when the phone needs to be charged. The small ring on the back is on a swivel, so it can be turned when you want to use the grip as a stand, which is very sturdy.\n\nThe ring is embellished with 5 inset faux diamonds and is highly polished like a piece of jewelry.\n\nThis Magnetic Phone Grip would make a great gift!"},{"name":"Nichole","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"4/5","reviewTitle":" Stylish","review":"I love the look of it, very sleek look.

More versatile than I thought and pretty.","review":"This magnetic phone ring holder/stand is really pretty. The pearly looking green color is beautiful and the rose gold with little \"diamond\" gems looks fancy, much better than some pop socket or strictly utilitarian ring holder. I'm using it on an S22+. I did not use their included circular rings to adhere it. I've found in the past that similar rings didn't typically stick well though again I did not test these as I use my own magnet on my case.\n\nI didn't realize when I ordered this that besides the ring flipping up and down 180¬∞ it can also spin since that little rose gold ball rotates 360¬∞. With some ring holders you have to actually spin the entire magnetic piece to get a different orientation of the ring so I really liked that. The magnet on the ring holder itself is very strong. I have no feeling that it would accidentally come unattached, it's really on there. It works pretty well as a stand (with the phone horizontally). Time will tell if it gets loose/floppy with a lot of use.\n\nOverall it's super pretty and so far I'm really happy with it. It's better than I thought it would be. Would recommend."},{"name":"Mo","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Strong magnetic hold and very beautiful","review":"I've tried a handful of magsafe rings lately and this is one of my favorites.
