        "review": "I am a huge tootsie roll fan and that is bulk of what is in this mix, but I also love Dots and mini sugar daddy suckers - which were a surprise because I didn't see the mini sugar daddies in the photo on the ad. Everything else is... well... 'ok.' A lot of Charm suckers (with bubble gum in the center) - YUCK. I toss those.\nBut to each his own! Maybe you like them! All are fresh enough and tasty. I rarely buy these, but love the small sizes = less guilt. The bag arrived in great shape along with other stuff I had ordered. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful."
