The metal exterior ring also serves as a kickstand. The inner ring is for the finger.\n\nThe magnet is thick and durable. It has a good adherence to the case of my phone. When it is on the case it can be turned 360¬∞. I can even do this when all of the rings are down and touching my case. They made this perfect to fit inside the case without the outer ring hitting the rim of my case.\n\nWhen I have the finger ring propped out it can be swiveled outward more than 90 degrees. It does stop so that it doesn‚Äôt continue opening up. I like this so that I can put pressure back onto my phone and have a secure grip using the ring. The rain comes in handy when I am taking selfies. It also is a added security when I‚Äôm using my phone for Apple Pay or showing the screen of my phone to another person. It makes it far more difficult for the phone to slip out of my hands when I have the ring on my fingers.\n\nThe large outer ring allows me to prop my phone up. I can prop it up both in the landscape position or the portrait position. It is firm enough and it‚Äôs open position that I can actually touch my phone without it collapsing. The large circle makes for a great kickstand base so that the phone is far less likely to tip over the way it tends to with a small ring acting as a kickstand.\n\nThe magnet is black in colors. The inner and outer rings are both metal. The metal is strong and has the appearance of a metallic gunmetal. It is a very dark silver. All the hinges for the rings are the same material and color as the rings."},{"name":"xeromist","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"3/5","reviewTitle":" Weaker magnet than competition, absolutely massive!, double ring is nice","review":"I have a few MagSafe devices so I tried this with multiple phones and mounts. On one of the phones the magnetic hold is nice and strong but on the other phone it is just barely adequate. A vigorous shake and it falls right off. That second device has a weaker magnet so it's not entirely this product's fault but I have a competing MagSafe socket that holds strong on the same phone, so this one could be better.\n\nI tried putting this socket on two MagSafe car mounts and it doesn't grab on the back side. This isn't an advertised feature but other MagSafe sockets can be used on mounts while still attached to your phone.\n\nThis thing is huge! 67mm across, 5mm thick, 50g of added weight! On smaller phones this will be nearly as wide as your phone. This is somewhat expected because you are getting two rings but you won't forget it's on your phone. The thickness is a bit puzzling. The actual pop rings are maybe 3.5mm like other sockets but the magnetic ring is notably thicker. So you end up with a gap between the pop rings and your phone. They don't sit flush. The only thing that comes to mind is some phones having a camera bump close to the charging coil, so they had to add extra height to be more compatible.\n\nI will say, if you use your phone for a lot of media consumption the large ring is great! It stays at whatever angle you set and the large size provides great stability, unlike smaller rings that can be awkward to get a perfect angle.\n\nPersonally, I don't see myself using this one often. I feel like I have to give up too much in terms of bulk and weight, plus not being able to use it on mounts. It's a nice idea but just not worth it in my opinion."},{"name":"Lady J","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"4/5","reviewTitle":" Great magnetic phone grip & stand","review":"I really love all things MagSafe, and this is no exception.\n\nMy pros: This magnetic phone grip fits our iPhone 14 Pro phone perfectly. Its unique features make it stand out from other similar grips. There are two rings- a small inner ring that fits both large and small fingers, and a larger outer ring that rotates and serves as a stand for the phone. The stand feature works in both landscape and portrait mode, and has a flat base for better stability, great for viewing or filming video! The inner ring does not rotate, but the whole magnet will rotate easily, even while on your finger.\n\nMy cons: The magnet is just barely average in grip strength. It comes off easier than other magnetic grip, while still having good stickiness to our MagSafe cases from Spiegen. It will come off if put into a pants pocket. You can't have this mounted on the phone and still attach it to a magnetic phone stand or car charger, as you can with other grips with stronger magnets.\n\nWe really love the design of this magnetic grip/stand, it just needs slightly stronger magnets to serve our needs. It might well be sticky enough for you, if you don't need a gorilla strength magnet like we do."},{"name":" Customer","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"1/5","reviewTitle":" Weak magnet","review":"My pop-socket MagSafe broke in a fall so I bought this trying to replace it. Thought it would be stronger, as the the other reviews say.\n\nThey were wrong. It is not nearly as strong as popsocket. Not even close. It felt so weak. It kept coming off. I returned it that same day and ordered another pop socket. I‚Äôm not a fan of how the pop sockets break if you drop the phone, but the magnet is fantastic and that matters more.\n\nThis product is a dud"},{"name":"Shawna N.","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"1/5","reviewTitle":" Does not stick well to phone","review":"If I can give no stars I would. This product is false advertisement. WASTE of money. Don‚Äôt spend your money on this.\nThe magnetic attachment does NOT stick very well to the back of the phone when doing active motions.

It does magnetize well and makes it easy to set my phone up. However I‚Äôm more used to pop sockets so trying to hold the rings wasn‚Äôt as comfortable or natural. I tried it on my daughters iPhone 13 and it does still fit the back of that phone too but is much closer to the edges on that one."}]},{"id":"F_aZGg","title":"Nerds Grape & Strawberry Candy, 1.65 Ounce,( Pack Of 24)","imageUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/71fHhLuwj-L._SX425_PIbundle-24,TopRight,0,0_AA425SH20_.jpg","price":"$25.40","description":"Tiny, tangy, crunchy candy, Nerds are delicious little characters‚Äîsmall and peculiarly shaped yet lovably packed with taste.
