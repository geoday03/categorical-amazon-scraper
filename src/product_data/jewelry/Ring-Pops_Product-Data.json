The 4th grade boys at the party were happy to have them included in the goody bags.

I will buy more for next Halloween again to keep in a separate bowl from our regular candy and the other bowl of non-edible treats (little party favor toys I get on Amazon or at the party store‚Äîthose are great too because they don‚Äôt go bad, so I pack up the leftovers in a big ziploc and have them ready for next Halloween)."},{"name":"Cheyenne","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Excellent","review":"Love a good ring pop."},{"name":"Virginia Maxwell","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Candy for kidd","review":"Greatgrands loved them"},{"name":"Cecilia Mejias","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Great party gifts","review":"Everyone loves ring pops and left with blue tongue!

I love how cheap the item was compared to a lot of other shops on . Not only was it cheap, but the Seller shipped out the item very fast. I got it in 4 days and my little nieces were very happy to get their hands on it!! I will definitely be making another purchase in the future!!"},{"name":"Ripken2131cal","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"4/5","reviewTitle":" She said yes!","review":"Then she dumped me before the wedding:( These were temporary until I got her a real ring"},{"name":"Trixie Berg","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Great value","review":"Perfect for gift bags"},{"name":"Jaush","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"2/5","reviewTitle":" 3 ‚â† 4","review":"Package says 4 but only contained only 3.\nThe package also displays 4 flavor options, Strawberry, Watermelon, Blue Raspberry and Cherry. One would think you‚Äôd receive one of each of the four flavors to make up the 4 pops per package. Instead I got two Strawberry and one Watermelon. You might have better luck.
