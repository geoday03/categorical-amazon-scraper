The clear cone protecting the LED is study, but we have had one break at the joint between disk the candy actually sits on and the battery housing. Luckily this doesn't allow the button batteries to come out, but it does expose the LED which can be a hazard with smaller children.

The metal exterior ring also serves as a kickstand. The inner ring is for the finger.\n\nThe magnet is thick and durable. It has a good adherence to the case of my phone. When it is on the case it can be turned 360¬∞. I can even do this when all of the rings are down and touching my case. They made this perfect to fit inside the case without the outer ring hitting the rim of my case.\n\nWhen I have the finger ring propped out it can be swiveled outward more than 90 degrees. It does stop so that it doesn‚Äôt continue opening up. I like this so that I can put pressure back onto my phone and have a secure grip using the ring. The rain comes in handy when I am taking selfies. It also is a added security when I‚Äôm using my phone for Apple Pay or showing the screen of my phone to another person. It makes it far more difficult for the phone to slip out of my hands when I have the ring on my fingers.\n\nThe large outer ring allows me to prop my phone up. I can prop it up both in the landscape position or the portrait position. It is firm enough and it‚Äôs open position that I can actually touch my phone without it collapsing. The large circle makes for a great kickstand base so that the phone is far less likely to tip over the way it tends to with a small ring acting as a kickstand.\n\nThe magnet is black in colors. The inner and outer rings are both metal. The metal is strong and has the appearance of a metallic gunmetal. It is a very dark silver. All the hinges for the rings are the same material and color as the rings."},{"name":"xeromist","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"3/5","reviewTitle":" Weaker magnet than competition, absolutely massive!, double ring is nice","review":"I have a few MagSafe devices so I tried this with multiple phones and mounts. On one of the phones the magnetic hold is nice and strong but on the other phone it is just barely adequate. A vigorous shake and it falls right off. That second device has a weaker magnet so it's not entirely this product's fault but I have a competing MagSafe socket that holds strong on the same phone, so this one could be better.\n\nI tried putting this socket on two MagSafe car mounts and it doesn't grab on the back side. This isn't an advertised feature but other MagSafe sockets can be used on mounts while still attached to your phone.\n\nThis thing is huge! 67mm across, 5mm thick, 50g of added weight! On smaller phones this will be nearly as wide as your phone. This is somewhat expected because you are getting two rings but you won't forget it's on your phone. The thickness is a bit puzzling. The actual pop rings are maybe 3.5mm like other sockets but the magnetic ring is notably thicker. So you end up with a gap between the pop rings and your phone. They don't sit flush. The only thing that comes to mind is some phones having a camera bump close to the charging coil, so they had to add extra height to be more compatible.\n\nI will say, if you use your phone for a lot of media consumption the large ring is great! It stays at whatever angle you set and the large size provides great stability, unlike smaller rings that can be awkward to get a perfect angle.\n\nPersonally, I don't see myself using this one often. I feel like I have to give up too much in terms of bulk and weight, plus not being able to use it on mounts. It's a nice idea but just not worth it in my opinion."},{"name":"Lady J","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"4/5","reviewTitle":" Great magnetic phone grip & stand","review":"I really love all things MagSafe, and this is no exception.\n\nMy pros: This magnetic phone grip fits our iPhone 14 Pro phone perfectly. Its unique features make it stand out from other similar grips. There are two rings- a small inner ring that fits both large and small fingers, and a larger outer ring that rotates and serves as a stand for the phone. The stand feature works in both landscape and portrait mode, and has a flat base for better stability, great for viewing or filming video! The inner ring does not rotate, but the whole magnet will rotate easily, even while on your finger.\n\nMy cons: The magnet is just barely average in grip strength. It comes off easier than other magnetic grip, while still having good stickiness to our MagSafe cases from Spiegen. It will come off if put into a pants pocket. You can't have this mounted on the phone and still attach it to a magnetic phone stand or car charger, as you can with other grips with stronger magnets.\n\nWe really love the design of this magnetic grip/stand, it just needs slightly stronger magnets to serve our needs. It might well be sticky enough for you, if you don't need a gorilla strength magnet like we do."},{"name":" Customer","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"1/5","reviewTitle":" Weak magnet","review":"My pop-socket MagSafe broke in a fall so I bought this trying to replace it.

The pearly looking green color is beautiful and the rose gold with little \"diamond\" gems looks fancy, much better than some pop socket or strictly utilitarian ring holder. I'm using it on an S22+. I did not use their included circular rings to adhere it. I've found in the past that similar rings didn't typically stick well though again I did not test these as I use my own magnet on my case.\n\nI didn't realize when I ordered this that besides the ring flipping up and down 180¬∞ it can also spin since that little rose gold ball rotates 360¬∞. With some ring holders you have to actually spin the entire magnetic piece to get a different orientation of the ring so I really liked that. The magnet on the ring holder itself is very strong.

It still works well although i am looking to purchase a new one in the next 6 months or so, which will be the exact same one as i currently have.\nSince my last update, my ring has lost its original coating, and the coating under that just about everywhere. The place where my finger touches the ring the most has even eroded some of the metal, or at least, that's what I think has happened based on how it looks (if i remember, I'll take a photo in daylight and post it)\nThe pin that holds the ring attached to the base has come out of one end, but still holds it all together from the remaining end.\nI've super glued the ring onto the back of my case as after some time it just didn't gold any longer; probably because of the shungite pieces I've shoved inside my protective case and not because of the ring itself. It just hasn't got much hold with a back that's bumpy and without super glue. Even so, i still use it and love it as i did 2 years ago and so far this has been my longest lasting phone ring ever. I definitely recommend 2000%\n\n1st UPDATE:\nIt is now several months since I purchased this ring. It is still working. I never bothered buying another ring from someplace else because I figured I had spent enough money trying to find a ring that doesn't fall apart. I got used to the size of this one, and now it's large-ness doesn't seem an issue anymore. I had one sticker come loose on me in all this time. I couldn't find my spares and contacted the seller to purchase some, but they were kind enough to send me replacements without asking me to pay for it. Customer service is top and so is this ring. It's lasted longer than my previous 2 combined. The dark color has rubbed off in some places, exposing a copper finish, but I really don't care about that.\nI also purchased one of those magnetic ring holders that you push onto your car air vent from somewhere else, and it holds really well as well. I've increased my stars from 3 to 5. I'll definitely buy again, though it looks like I won't have to for some time.\n\nOriginal review:\nThe ring quality seems made very well and sturdy. I've only had it for about 2 weeks though, and my previous 2 (different brands) lasted about 4-6 months so it's difficult to tell just how durable this ring is. But, so far, it looks very promising.\n\nApplication was easy and the ring works well. I like that it came with more sticky circles to change into new phones, or smaller rings? -> My only problem is that the ring is huge! I can fit 2 fingers in down to my middle finger bones, which makes the ring rather useless for my skinny fingers. The diameter is 1.5 inches / 3 cm wide\n\nI've contacted the company a few days after receiving my ring asking if they have a smaller size I could exchange mine for, but have not yet received a response, despite their email stating that if I had any issues I'd receive immediate attention ü§® hence the reduced stars. Obviously their customer service department cares less than they want us to think they do. Hopefully I can find a smaller ring and make it work as well as this one."},{"name":"Heather","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"4/5","reviewTitle":" Still on the fence!","review":"¬†It is great at first, the ring can be used as a stand, its super easy to keep a firm grip on the phone and its very low profile. Now three and a half months later I am saying save your money, the ring no longer acts as a stand (it just flattens out as soon as the weight is on it) and the whole thing is coming apart at the pivot point. It‚Äôs unfortunate because in theory this is an amazing cell phone grip, the execution of the product need major improvement!\n\nUpdate: after I wrote my original review this company reached out to me, they sent me a replacement saying that I must‚Äôve had a defective product, and so far so good! That was a couple months ago and this ring is still holding strong! I‚Äôm going to update my review accordingly from a two star rating to a four star rating, ( four stars instead of five because it does seem to be loosening just slightly, Which I do understand will happen with repetitive use), I will update should this product prove to be as good as I had originally hoped or should it prove to be just a good concept that is poorly executed! I definitely give the company five stars for their customer service however!

I used some scotch tape to temporarily hold the ring in different places to see what felt right for me and my hand. Turns out toward the bottom and slightly left of center works best for me. Once I had my ideal spot, I cleaned the back with the alcohol pad, applied both the disc and sticker as instructed. Even in the location I placed the ring, it still has no problem propping up my phone (Galaxy 10) in vertical or horizontal position. The rotation and kickstand firm enough, so it won't collapse.

But I had a couple friends rave about it, and I read through all the reviews so I figured I'd bite the bullet.\n\nI placed it fairly low on my phone, which was awesome as I could use it to stand my phone up both vertically and horizontally. This was a compromise as it's not as useful as having it in the middle, but using it as a stand to take photos and watch movies on planes is great, as well as being able to hang it on a hook while showering etc.\n\nThe reason I've given it a 3/5 star rating is because after 5 weeks the adhesive has already failed and I had to spend a good 30 minutes cleaning off the old adhesive (Goo Gone and isopropyl alcohol). They included an extra 3 adhesive pads, but at this rate that'll only last me 3-4 months. I'm hoping that this doesn't happen as quickly again, but if it does I may consider lowering my review further."},{"name":"Karyne Whalen","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"4/5","reviewTitle":" Put a ring on it üòÇ","review":"***update after 5 months use below***\nI wanted this holder to use for taking photos on my new to me Samsung S20 until I buy a new Loopy Case. I am happy with the adhesion and sturdiness which makes me confident taking photos knowing my phone won't drop. It is a little awkward to hold but I may have placed it in the wrong spot on the back of my phone case-centre. Added bonus is the magnet adheres to my car vent cell phone holder. And I have used it as a stand watching Netflix on the run and is sturdy. In addition, it is also thin and not bulky and I think looks aethestically pleasing. I have only been using this ring holder for a month so I will report back if I run into problems but for now I am happy with the price point and this ring holder.\n***update: I have been using it for 5 months now and it is still holding up.

The one on my phone is a vinyl material and has an alligator design, so it's raised in parts. This ring adhered to it without a problem, and has held up to daily use since April. If the ring is tight, that's because the adhesive they use for the back goes over the ring part, so the ring gets stuck to the glue and makes it hard to turn. But I found 2 things work to fix that: First, when you adhere the ring, don't push the center where the ring is, just push all around it. This way the ring part itself doesn't get adhered by the glue. 2nd, if you do push it where the ring is, just keep turning the ring to try to break the seal of the glue. Just keep doing that a number of times until it loosens up enough for you. I would think if you do it too much it will get too loose, don't know, never got that far. But I've used both methods on these type of ring holders and both work, I've just never turned the ring until it was too loose. I'd recommend these."}]},{"category":"Ring Pops","id":"uJoIvZ","title":"Zollipops Clean Teeth Lollipops - AntiCavity Sugar Free Candy with Xylitol for a Healthy Smile Great for Kids, Diabetics and Keto Diet.

An absolute steal!","review":"Why can't other candy manufacturers offer deals like this? I've looked all over  for similar deals on bulk purchases of candy, and nothing even comes close.\n\nBut I digress. Taffy is as classic a form of candy as the chocolate bar, and Airheads are the best taffy I've ever had. You get 60 bars in this box for just $8 dollars, making it an absolute steal. I buy one every few months as a special treat for myself. No regrets.\n\nMy only complaint is the \"White Mystery\" flavor. Good God, I wish Airheads would cut with this stupid gimmick and just give us an identifiable flavor like Strawberry or Lemon. The White Mystery kind of tastes like lemon to me, though I tend to notice White Mystery also has a very mild pungent aftertaste.\n\nThe rest of the flavors are just fine, though I have a weakness for the Red Cherry and Orange bars. Not much else to say. Mostly great taste, and a great deal. Just replace White Mystery with an identifiable flavor and I'd give it 5 stars across the board."},{"name":"Sherlyn R.

Most questions were asking what do they look like? Well, these airheads are very slim flat, and rectangle-shaped some are not the \" perfect rectangle shape\" each has its own oddy weird shape. What this means is due to the wrapper of the candy being a \" rectangle\" you're going to get some airheads that are smaller or bigger than others. with dome tops or slimmer than others. Sometimes the candy can be thick or smaller as shown in the picture\"\n\nThe Taste: Do they taste good? What do they taste like?\nNow, this is my own opinion but my first box was horrible! I was disappointed in my first box of 60 airheads however I purchased another giving them another chance glad I did! In my first box, the only flavors that tasted great were the orange and grape and I hate those flavors! Normally I purchase red, blue, white and green. If you do have a faint taste, the flavor is dull and tastes like something left out for a couple of days trust me.... it's normal. I know most people would write a horrible review based on the taste\" of the product but give them another try. In my opinion, they taste like the canned juice you can purchase from the store just simply add water\" OR high sugary juice boxes/kool-aid jammers/packs.I would compare them to old wrapp up candies you would find in a doctor's office or your grandma's candy dish with the little fruit on them. When the airheads are \" cold\" just set them aside in a drawer or cupboard where ever you put your treats at this point let them get to room temp before eating them. NOW, do not put them in the microwave to \" heat them up\" I know some people on the internet will mistake that. UNLESS YOU WANT TO CLEAN UP A MESS DONT COOK/ MICROWAVE THESE. Just leave them be until the candy is soft and enjoy.\n\nThe Texture: when cold, it's hard on the teeth and taste nasty as hell. It's like having a leftover lollipop that has been licked but leftover for a couple of weeks or old Halloween candy. When the candy is warm\" it's soft, chewy, but still has that hard like candy taste, sometimes it has this weird grain-like texture which is still chewy. I wouldn't recommend having a lot 2-3 max. These are great for someone trying to cut down on their sugar or replacing it with a better alternative than pop/soda. The product is workable /playable if you wanted to cut out weird shapes for cake decorating or cupcakes you can use a cookie cutter to make cute shapes. You can roll out the candy too ( when the airheads are warm) however don't roll them out too much they still break/ tear easily. If I were to compare the candy hardness think of old gum being left out but with flavor yeah disgusting I know but you get the point. It's not like a fruit roll-up but they do tear somewhat like one but just harder slightly.\nYou will find sometimes some airheads have hard bits of candy in them it happens doesn't mean they don't \" dry out\" my guess is from the processes of making them that's why you get some hard little candy bits. They do have a grease-like coating on them to help them out of the wrapper, unlike Laffy taffy. However, warning to all you parents out there don't let your kid leave them on tables or any type of hard surface. It does stick to the surface and sometimes leaves that tacky feeling or hard residue. Now, I WILL SET PEOPLE STRAIGHT ON THIS. Laffy taffy is more like a \"soft chewy candy\" kinda like when you bite into them, you can pull and stretch the candy that retains not only the bite mark but also your teeth impression and the stretch of the candy too. Airheads are not like that. Nor are they a challenge to get out when the candy is warm. If you know anything about Laffy Taffy it's not coated with some type of grease which again as stated the airheads are. Laffy taffy when warm is a $$#h to get out of the wrapper and sticky, sometimes it take 5- 10 mins just to get the wrapper off the candy ( if you're lucky that is) Laffy Taffy, also feels like a smoothie going down your throat, very thick like texture. So, thick think of peanut butter smacking and stunk in the back of your throat. Don't get me wrong Laffy Taffy is great candy but comparing airheads to Laffy taffy... no no no ;)\n\nWorth The money? I'm from Canada and we have location stores like 7/11 or any small business shop that sells them for 50-80 cents sometimes even a $1.00 So say if you wanted to purchase a bunch of these just to have a treat for your little ones or for yourself it's worth your money! For $13-14 dollars plus shipping (free) if you're a prime is worth it! Rather than spending almost $30.00. Now I'm a foodie and love having sweet treats, tea or coffee when I draw sometimes I eat them when I game too. Yes, I'm an artist/gamer and I love stuffing my face ;) having these little guys are great for a snack or when I'm doing long streams and need a sugar boost.\n\nPackaging normally: has 2 ways you can open the package. 1 is the typical way to follow the lines or flip it over to the \" bottom-side\" and rip off the remaining package and fold the logo. * Think of how you normally buy airheads from the store that's an open box\"\n\nHope this helps."},{"name":"Diana","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Yummy!!","review":"Second time ordering these and I was curious to see how many of each flavour I got as last time I didn‚Äôt bother to check.

After talking to some friends, doing some research and assesing my needs I settled on TP-Link because of the variety of Smart products they offered, no requirements for a Hub, the lower cost and the ability to control everything from one simple app on my Smart phone and \"s Alexa.\nI have not been disappointed. After a very short learning curve, I surprisingly found the installation and set-up of all the TP-Link Smart devices extremely easy and intuitive. I have installed several different Smart devices including three different bulbs (LB-100, 120 & 130) depending on the area, as well as, Smart Switches (HB-200) and Smart Plugs. All of it has installed, programed and worked with few problems.\nThe only criticism I have is the Kasa App. I have found it to be a bit bugy at times, but since I use it primarily for programming and setting up new devices and scenes, rather than operationally, it has not been an issue since Alexa handels most of that work. So far, in the six weeks my Smart Home has been in operation I have only had one problem where Alexa and the Kasa app lost communication with most of (but not all) of my TP-Link devices. But after a bit of head scratching I was able to restore communication.\nSo here's a tip to remember: I first tried rebooting the devices by cycling the power breaker, but that didn't work. Probably due to multiple devices signaling simultaneously and overloading Kasa. But, powering each device down for a few seconds then back up, and testing it before moving on ro the next one worked without a problem.\nI also recommend using a different control application. I only have experience with Amazon Alexa, but it also interfaces with Google Home among others. I have found that controlling scenes from Kasa not to be reluable for some reason, while issuing the scene commands to Alexa works 90% of the time, with repeating the command becoming necessary about 10% of the time. But even with an occasional repeated command being necessary, TP-Link devices respond extremely well through Alexa's control. Plus Alexa is able to easily \"group\" multiple devices so you can control areas with a single command, or program macro activities that Alexa can perform with a single command. Capabilities Kasa does not have.\nThis is another deficiency of the Kasa app. Without the ability to group devices or run macro routines, it relies on programmed scenes which are very limiting for operational control. So another controlling app like Alexa or Home is essential to the TP-Link Smart Home system.\nFor me, because I have Alexa for operational control, both at home and away, these short comings in the Kasa app are non-issues. But if I didnt have this capability I think I would look to a different Hub controlled platform for my Smart Home lighting and device control.\n\nHS-200 Smart Switch:\nI am a retired electrician, so I found the installation easy. Most DIY homeowners with a basic knowledge of electricity and components should also have few problems with the installation.\nI found this Smart Switch easy to control and the installation is about the same as replacing a standard light switch. But, a big drawback is not have a dimming capability. To me this should be a no-brainer and i cant understand why this featire is lacking. Because that would makevthis a 5 star product.\nSo before you procede there are a couple of precautions that should be noted.\nFirst, you must three wires plus the ground (usually bare or green), and one must be the neutral (usually white) third wire, or the switch simply will not work. This can be an issue in some older homes (and even in some newer ones too).\nThe neutral wire is the \"common\" wire that runs throughout the house and is common to all circuits. It completes the loop in the circuit from the electrical box to the receptacle. The \"hot\" (or \"line\") wire (usually black) carries the electrical load for that circuit only (usually 15-20 amps max). And finally, the \"load\" wire (usually black, red, or it could even be white) completes the hot side of the circuit between the switch and the receptacle. To save time and money some electricians when wiring homes \"old school\" would complete the light circuit by running the neutral to the light receptacle and then run a 2 conductor (plus ground) to the switch. So even though you may have a white and black wire at the switch, the white wire is not a neutral, but the load wire that that completes the hot circuit when the switch is turned on (closed). So if you don't have 3 wires, one of them being the white neutral, you are out of luck using a Smart Switch. You can control the light however, by using Smart bulbs and then grouping them in the controling app (like Alexa).\nAnother caution is wire management. Standard light switches don't take up much room, so the original installing electrician had lots of room in the box to stuff extra wire. This is a luxury you don't have since the Smart Switch is much deeper and takes up most of the box. The new switch also uses leads that are wire nutted to the circuit wires and not terminated on the switch itself. Because of this, it may be necessay to shorten the wires to make room in the box for the extra electronics and wire nuts.\nMy advice is to open your intended switch boxes to survey your electrical wiring BEFORE you order the switches, so there are no surprises when it comes time to install.\nOne last safety precaution. Be sure to turn off the circuit at the electrical panel (breaker box). Also don't assume that all switches in a multi-switch box are on the same circuit. It is often the case that multiple circuits are in the box. This is especially true when a switch is controling a plug. So check all wires in the box with a meter to insure nothing is hot.\nFinally, when wire nutting multiple wires it is VERY EASY to leave a wire loose. This can be very dangerous, as loose wires can work themselves free and cause arking and sparking that can damage connected equipment, and worse, start a fire. This is a common cause of electrical fires, and you might not know there is a problem until it's too late. So to ensure all wire nut connections are tight and secure, tug on each wire at the nut with needle nose pliers. If you can't pull it loose it should be good to go. Also make sure there are no bare wires poking out of the nuts. The switches use stranded wire so it's easy to have some stray strands loose outside the nut.\nSo that's about it. The install is pretty easy most of the time, but if you don't think you're experienced enough to do the job safely, put this phase of the job in the hands of a professional. It should be an easy job for any professional electrician, and should not be terribly expensive. Consider it cheep insurance!"},{"name":"R.

I rated it a 3 for easy to install because you're going to be handling electrical work, and not everyone is going to be able to do that. But, if you've installed a light switch or an outlet before, it will be a breeze for you.\n\nI did have an issue with the faceplate, as I was putting it into a box with another switch, which was a standard sized switch, and couldn't find a faceplate that worked with that setup. But I have a 3D printer, so I printed one.\n\nI'm thinking about getting a pair of the 3-way version of this switche for another light in the house that my wife often asks me to turn on as I walk past the switch."},{"name":"C.

My units have continued to work successfully for well over a month now, including self recovering once power was restored from a power outage. All have continued to work flawlessly with all of my my Echo (Alexa) devices and I've been able to verify I can use the Kasa app to turn lights on and off from anywhere I have internet access on my cell phone.\n\nWhile I'm at it I should note that one limitation for these is that they are strictly single pole (SPST) switches, which means they can't be installed in place of a 3-way (SPDT) switch . It would be nice if TP-Link offered a 3-way version of the product for those of us who might want to use one with a multi-switch installation.\n\nUPDATE 2 (upgrade 1 star): I'm raising my previous 2 star downgrade to a 1 star downgrade since TP-Link finally recognized they had a serious disconnect between their Kasa app and 's Alexa app (it sure took them long enough). It appears (for now) that they have corrected whatever caused the problem, but I won't trust their Smart Home devices to retain their settings until my devices behave as advertised for at least a month. After the fix, for a plug I originally named \"Back Porch\" in the Kasa app and which I subsequently renamed \"Porch\", the Alexa app, even after rediscovery, insisted on looking for \"Back Porch\" from the Kasa app instead of \"Porch\" until I deleted it from the Alexa app and rediscovered it; i.e., there are still bugs. Otherwise, it's been so far so good, but I'm not convinced it won't revert again to the erratic behavior I experience over a period of about 3 weeks, long enough that I was tempted to scrub the whole kit and kaboodle. If TP-Link keeps their Smart Home devices squeaky clean for about the next 6 months, my confidence in them will be sufficiently restored to revert to my original 5-star assessment.\n\nUPDATE:1 (downgrade 2 stars): I'm lowering my review from 5 stars to 3 because these simply do not consistently behave. I have become expert at factory reset to get them operating again, but the key point is that I can't trust them to remain operational for more than a few hours before I get messages from Alexa that a device is not responding, or from the Kasa app that it can't find the device, sometimes after having set it up just a few hours earlier, and that's for a plug within a few feet of the my wi-fi range extender. It would appear TP-Link needs a firmware upgrade. I suppose I could replace my wi-fi router and range extender with one from TP-Link, but that seems stupid since my wi-fi works just fine with lap top, cell phone, TV, etc. Make no mistake, these represent a very cool idea, but as currently being sold they are way too finicky.\n\nOriginal review:\nI have 3 versions of the TP-Link Smart Home technology distributed within my house. Being able to control outlets and switches using them is perhaps the major reason I have that many. This is just one of a number of Smart Home products an Echo can handle. It differs from the plug ins in that you install it permanently in place of an existing manual wall switch. Installation is no different than installing any other wall switch, except this one is smart, at least in the sense that it can be operated by wifi as well as manually. The form factor is actually smaller than that of most dimmer modules, so it should fit in most switch boxes. After installation, you set it up for wifi via the (free) Kasa app (a very intuitive exercise) and from there tie it to your Echo system as a Smart Home product. In the Kasa app you can change the name to whatever you want and then have the (free) Echo app \"discover\" the new name. Operation is flawless and is entertaining (e.g., \"Alexa, turn on the patio light\", where \"patio light\" is the name you selected for the smart switch). You can operate it manually via the Kasa app, or via Alexa as you wish! You can also program it for automatic operation. Any one of my Echo's can operate it. It does require reasonable access to your home wifi network to work as advertised. I now have a number of Smart Home products installed, and the software does not seem to have any issues keeping them sorted out (far more reliably than the obsolete X-10 system I used to rely on).\n\nHere's my take on the steps for installation of the switch:\n1) first turn off the circuit breaker that controls the existing switch (easy to test, since if the switch doesn't work, the power to it is off);\n2) your existing switch should be across the \"hot\" line that supplies power to the load (a lamp or whatever), one black (hot) line for power coming in, and one black line for power passed on from the switch to the load. You simply remove the existing switch, disconnect its two black wires, and use wire nuts to hook them to the black wires for this switch (order doesn't matter).\n3) the \"return\" that completes the circuit is through the \"neutral\" white line (always present unless you have some really squirrely wiring). You hook the white wire to the neutral line using a wire nut, cutting/stripping the neutral wire as necessary (usually not necessary since most installations will already have a wire nut connection for the neutral line).\n4) if there is a ground line (a bare wire in the switch box) connect the green line to it using a wire nut (if not, don't bother, but insulate it using one of the wire nuts or electrical tape).\n5) turn the circuit breaker back on and verify the smart switch works as a manual switch, then go through the set up procedure.\n\nNOTE: 4 wire nuts are included in the package in case your current installation is one with the black wires attached directly to the old switch. A switch plate is included that you have to snap off for installation. The switch has the Decora form factor, so if your existing switch is not Decora style, you will need to use the included plate or pick up one from some place like Home Depot to match your needs."},{"name":"Jeff Hughes","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"5/5","reviewTitle":" Several installed easily with no issues","review":"I have several of them. All were easy to install and are working great. Integration with Google Home was super quick as well. The only minor negative is that the cover plate can sometimes be difficult to snap on if your gang boxes aren't flush with the drywall. With a little adjustment they are on. Notes: Requires a neutral wire, so if you have a switch that uses the neutral wire for the return power (taped black) it is recommended to have the wiring upgraded first. I also had one switch with no ground (old house) wire so I tied it to the neutral and have had no problems."},{"name":"Anthony","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"1/5","reviewTitle":" UPDATE 11/11/2018.

The only way for you to turn on/off this light switch now is to open the Kasa app on your phone, find the device on your list and toggle the power button. No more voice control. It's too late for me to return this product. Overall it works fine. Disconnects from wifi maybe once per month. You just have to reset the device when that happens. But this blocking of app functionality from Tplink has made this product essentially defective. Honestly who knows when they'll decide to fix it but the fact that the company can change their mind on connected ecosystems without warning has deterred me from ever buying their products again.

I bought these to replace my switches in the lobby area of my house, both the indoor lobby and outdoor porch light. The wiring in my house is... not great. As an electrician I can see that whoever last wired the switches did a terrible job and made installing these switches that much harder. They left almost nothing for the neutral.\n\nBefore you begin installing these switches, I must recommend you DO NOT install two side by side. Only one in a gang box. Two side by side is a nightmare to wire properly, as there is not enough room in the box for all the wires without forcing the switches in with all your body weight, and hoping nothing pops out or disconnects later. I hated installing this. It should have only taken an hour max to install, from the moment the breaker is turned off, to the moment it's in the app and I'm telling Alexa to turn the lights on and off. Instead, it took 4 hours trying to figure out what the wiring was for the house. For me, these are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- App was super easy to install, set up.\n- Works with Alexa and Google Home flawlessly\n- Looks good\n- Night light so you can see switch in dark conditions\n- Lots of spare wire in case of hillbilly wiring in house\n\nCons:\n- VERY DIFFICULT to install two in the same box\n- Feels weird to switch. The switch stays in the same position and is more like a button, compared to a classic rocker switch\n\nI'm happy that I bought these. It was also a good reminder that being an electrician can be fun no matter how aggravating the situation is. This was my first hardwire smart home installation and it went well."},{"name":"Borbo Rythme","pictureUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","rating":"1/5","reviewTitle":" Produit tr√®s dangereux","review":"J'ai utilis√© cet interrupteur pendant un an sans probl√®me.
