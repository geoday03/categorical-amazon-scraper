One would think you‚Äôd receive one of each of the four flavors to make up the 4 pops per package. Instead I got two Strawberry and one Watermelon. You might have better luck. Thankfully the pops weren‚Äôt crushed like others have mentioned."

The kids went NUTS about the push pops and ring pops, some of them ran away shouting to other kids to come get some. It was awesome! Both younger and older kids chose these over full size candy bars, we should‚Äôve had more of these because we ran out of these first. We will definitely get two or three boxes for next year, it made us a very popular trick or treat house and we are all about Halloween so we were really happy with the enthusiasm."
